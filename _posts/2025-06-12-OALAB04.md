# What is YARA

## How does it work 

In a YARA rule you define patterns, YARA will then try to match those patterns in files.
It can be strings, hexa bytes, etc. 

## Type and Goals for YARA rules

### To identify malware on disk (Packed)
- short lifespan
- can be used in EDR
- used for early delivery stage identification (Scripts, Docs, ETC)

### To identify malware family (Unpacked)
- identify specific malware families
- require unpack / memory samples 

### Hunting rules (Malware Characteristics)
- quick to develop 
- not useful for alerting 
- require manual triage of the results
- used for searching similar malware and identifying generic malware characteristics 

## Efficient tips 

1. Avoid short strings 
2. Avoid breaking hexadecimal strings into sections smaller than 4 bytes
3. Don't use leading or trailing wildcards in hexadecimal strings
4. Avoid regular expressios
5. Avoid strings with single repeated byte
6. Use `nocase` string modifier sparingly

# YARA for Malware Hunting

## UnpacMe

In [UnpacMe](https://www.unpac.me/) you can search samples matching a YARA rule, with that in mind you can try to search for versions of a malware, or for whole family malware 

# YARA in Threat Intelligence

1. Generate a loose "hunting" rule 

2. Find related samples :
  - YARA -s to isolate matching features
  - bindiff to identify matching functions 
  - manual analysis 

3. Tighten rule to make "signature"

4. (Optional) Create "feature" rules
