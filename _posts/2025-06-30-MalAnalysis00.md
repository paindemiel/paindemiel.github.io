## introduction 

## 00 - Lab setup 

A proper malware analysis environment requires multiple specialized virtual machines to handle different analysis techniques safely and effectively. The lab setup consists of four dedicated VMs: a static analysis Windows VM ; a dynamic analysis Windows VM ; a static and network analysis Linux VM; and a dynamic analysis VM running CAPEv2 (Cuckoo Advanced Persistent Evaluation) for automated sandbox analysis and behavioral profiling. Each VM is isolated with proper network segmentation, snapshot management, and dedicated toolchains to ensure safe malware analysis without cross-contamination between analysis phases.
