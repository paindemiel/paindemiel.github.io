## Overview

This post covers reverse engineering challenges from [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/), a platform dedicated to reverse engineering exercises. The difficulty and quality ratings range from 1 to 6.

## Challenge 1: Basic Arithmetic

### Challenge Information
- **Difficulty**: 1.0
- **Quality**: 4.0
- **Download**: [here.zip](https://crackmes.one/static/crackme/685048992b84be7ea7743940.zip)

### Analysis Approach

### Code Logic Breakdown

The program implements a simple arithmetic validation:

1. **Input Storage**:
   - First input is stored in `v11`
   - Second input is stored in `v10`

2. **Arithmetic Operation**:
   - `v12` contains the result of an operation on `v11`
   - The operation: multiply by 20 and add 4

3. **Data Type Analysis**:
   - `v11` is a dword where each input is a word
   - Maximum two two-digit numbers can be stored
   - `v11[0]` represents the first word
   - `v11[1]` represents the second word

4. **Validation Logic**:
   - Comparison between `<first input>*20+4` and the second input
   - Success condition: second value must equal `<first value>*20+4`

### Solution Strategy

To solve this challenge, you need to:
1. Choose a first input value
2. Calculate: `first_value * 20 + 4`
3. Use this result as the second input

## Challenge 2: Character Validation

### Challenge Information
- **Difficulty**: 1.5
- **Quality**: 4.2
- **Download**: [here.zip](https://crackmes.one/static/crackme/68374c6f6297cca3ff7d7d7e.zip)

### Initial Testing

Starting with input `aaaaaa` resulted in "you lose".

### Main Function Analysis

### Control Flow Analysis

1. **Variable Assignment**:
   - `v3` equals the length of the input string

2. **Execution Paths**:
   - Going to `label_13` results in losing
   - Going through `label_9` then `label_14` results in winning

3. **Character Validation Loop**:
   - While loop comparing each input character
   - Current character must be `<= '9'` and `>= '0'` (numeric validation)
   - Condition: `v-48` should equal `v7%10`

4. **Success Condition**:
   - `v11` is set to the winning string
   - `label_14` prints the success message

### Solution Discovery

After observing the character range validation (`'9'` and `'0'`), testing with multiple `'0'` characters proved successful but it's not the write analysis...

### Key Insights

- **Numeric Input Required**: Only digits 0-9 are accepted
- **Modulo Operation**: The validation uses modulo 10 arithmetic
- **Pattern Recognition**: The solution involves understanding the mathematical relationship between input characters and the modulo operation
