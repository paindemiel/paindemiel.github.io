First thing after unzipping the malware, I change the extension for .mal so I can't execute it by mystake :

![renaming](assets/images/hackthebox/payload/rename.png)

# start

Let's start by the `start` while `pestudio` is loading the malware :

# sub_140001154

Following we will look at sub_140001154, as the function is pretty long we will start by listing the API calls :

## API calls

- [GetStartupInfoA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getstartupinfow) : it looks like there is a sort of error and we can't access the GetStartupInfoA documentation page so here is a link for GetStartupInfoW, so this function seems to retrieve a [StartupInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-startupinfoa) structure which is used to describe the appearance of a gui or terminal 
- [Sleep](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleep) : This function just temporary pause the execution of the current process
- [SetUnhandledExceptionFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-setunhandledexceptionfilter) : It allow the application to specify a function ("exception filter") that will be callend whenever an unhandled exception occurs in any thread of the process

- [NtCurrentTeb](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/nf-winnt-ntcurrentteb) : this routine returns pointer to the [Thread Environment Block](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-teb) of current thread 
- [InterlockedCompareExchange64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/nf-winnt-interlockedcompareexchange64) : atomic compare-and-exchange operation on specified values

- [_initterm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/initterm-initterm-e?view=msvc-170) : internal methods that should not be used in a program so it's strange

## discovery 

- line 30 we have a while `(1)` that may be representative of a CFGF but hase we have some code execution before it may be something else...

![ida2](/assets/images/hackthebox/payload/ida2.png)

- line 49 a call to a function that will finally call vprintf
