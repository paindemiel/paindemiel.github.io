## Overview

This post covers the analysis of the infamous WannaCry ransomware as part of the PMAT (Practical Malware Analysis and Triage) course. WannaCry, which emerged in May 2017, was a global ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers across 150 countries. We'll examine both static and dynamic analysis techniques to understand its behavior and capabilities.

## Basic Static Analysis

### PEStudio Analysis

#### General Characteristics
- **SHA256**: 24D004A104D4D54034DBCFFC2A4B19A11F39008A575AA614EA04703480B1022C
- **Architecture**: 32-bit
- **Original file name**: lhdfrgui.exe
- **Type**: PE (Portable Executable)

#### Import Analysis
PEStudio highlights several suspicious imported libraries:
- `WS2_32.dll` - Windows Socket API for network communication
- `iphlpapi.dll` - IP Helper API for network configuration
- `WININET.dll` - Windows Internet API for HTTP/HTTPS communication

Among the imported functions, several interesting Windows API calls were identified (information sourced from malapi.io/microsoft), related to:
- Thread management and creation
- File operations and manipulation
- Network activity and communication
- Randomness generation for encryption keys

### FLOSS String Analysis

FLOSS (Fast Library Operating System Simulator) revealed several important strings:

- **Executable name**: tasksche.exe
- **Commands**: 
  - `TaskStart`
  - `icacls . /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q` (grants full permissions to everyone)
- **URL**: `http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com`
- **Error messages**: "unknown compression method"
- **Network targets**: 
  - `\\172.16.99.5\IPC$`
  - `\\192.168.56.20\IPC$`
- **File extensions**: `.sqlite3`, `.sqlitedb`, `.onetoc2`

### CAPA Analysis

CAPA (Capability Analysis) identified several malware capabilities:

### VirusTotal Analysis

VirusTotal flagged several suspicious behaviors:
- `detect-debug-environment` - Anti-debugging techniques
- `long-sleeps` - Sleep loops to evade analysis
- `cve-2017-0147` - EternalBlue vulnerability exploitation
- `checks-network-adapters` - Network enumeration
- `checks-user-input` - User interaction detection
- `runtime-modules` - Dynamic module loading
- `cve-2017-0144` - EternalRomance vulnerability exploitation

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

### Kill Switch Mechanism

One of WannaCry's most interesting features is its kill switch mechanism. Initially, the malware does not encrypt any files. Instead, it performs a critical check:

1. **URL Check**: The malware attempts to connect to the URL found in FLOSS analysis: `http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com`
2. **Conditional Execution**: 
   - If the URL is accessible and responds, the malware terminates without performing ransomware activities
   - If the URL is unreachable, the payload executes and begins encryption

This kill switch was likely designed to prevent the malware from running in analysis environments or to allow the attackers to stop the spread if needed.

### Registry Analysis with Regshot

Using Regshot to compare registry states before and after execution, we detected several changes:

- **Hidden Directory Creation**: The malware creates a hidden directory in `C:\ProgramData`
- **Malware Resources**: This directory contains various files including:
  - Executable files
  - Text files with ransom messages
  - Task data files
  - Configuration files

### Network Analysis with TCPView

TCPView revealed extensive network activity:

The malware attempts numerous connections to SMB (Server Message Block) on port 445 across different IP addresses, indicating:

- **Lateral Movement**: Attempts to spread to other systems on the network
- **EternalBlue Exploitation**: Uses the SMB vulnerability to propagate
- **Network Scanning**: Actively searches for vulnerable targets

## Technical Analysis Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Kill Switch Mechanism**: The malware includes a sophisticated kill switch that prevents execution if a specific URL is reachable
2. **Network Propagation**: Uses SMB vulnerabilities (EternalBlue/EternalRomance) for lateral movement
3. **File System Changes**: Creates hidden directories and modifies file permissions
4. **Anti-Analysis Techniques**: Implements debug detection and sleep loops
5. **Encryption Targeting**: Focuses on specific file extensions (.sqlite3, .sqlitedb, .onetoc2)

### Attack Flow

1. **Initialization**: Malware starts and checks for kill switch URL
2. **Environment Setup**: Creates hidden directory and necessary files
3. **Network Propagation**: Attempts to spread via SMB vulnerabilities
4. **File Encryption**: Begins encrypting targeted file types
5. **Ransom Demand**: Displays ransom message and demands payment

## Conclusion

WannaCry demonstrates sophisticated malware design with multiple layers of functionality:

- **Defensive Mechanisms**: Kill switch and anti-analysis techniques
- **Propagation Capabilities**: Network-based spreading using known vulnerabilities
- **Destructive Payload**: File encryption with ransom demands
- **Persistence**: Hidden file storage and system modifications

The analysis reveals why WannaCry was so effective - it combined multiple attack vectors with robust anti-detection mechanisms, making it a formidable threat that required coordinated global response efforts to contain.
