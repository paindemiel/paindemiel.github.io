# Hidding debugger : ScillaHide

Here we will talk about [ScillaHide](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide) to hide debugger, from the github you can download the latest reales (.zip one), once you unzipped it you can search for x64dbg for example, and then copy paste plugins in x64dbg directory : 

![tips01](/assets/images/tips/tips01.png)

And if we open x64dbg we can see it available in plugins :

![tips02](/assets/images/tips/tips02.png)

We could load a pe and then load the basic profile and start our analysis.

# low resources reverse : podman/radare2

You can launch a container with radare images with the following : `podman run --rm -ti radare/radare2`

After that you can `sudo apt update` and install `file` and `wget` packages.

And we could for example launch the analysis of a harmless sample from [crackme](https://crackmes.one/) by using wget to download it.

### Basic Commands
```bash
r2 -d file          # Debug mode
r2 -A file          # Analyze all
r2 -w file          # Write mode

### Navigation
```
s main              # Seek to main function
s sym.main          # Seek to main symbol
s 0x1000            # Seek to address
s-                   # Go back
s+                   # Go forward
s sym.imp.*         # Seek to imports
```

### Analysis
```
aa                  # Analyze all
aaa                 # Analyze all (recursive)
afl                 # List all functions
afl~main            # List functions containing "main"
axt @ sym.main      # Find cross-references to main

pdf 10              # Print 10 lines of disassembly
```

### Memory/Registers
```
dr                  # Show all registers
dr eax              # Show eax register
dr eax=0x10         # Set eax to 0x10

pxq 16 @ 0x1000     # Show 16 quadwords at address 0x1000
```

### Debugging
```
db 0x1000           # Set breakpoint at 0x1000
db-0x1000           # Remove breakpoint at 0x1000
db-*                # Remove all breakpoints
dc                  # Continue execution
ds                  # Step into
dso                 # Step over
dr rip              # Show instruction pointer
```

### Strings/Data
```
iz                  # Show strings in data section
izz                 # Show all strings in binary
iz~password         # Show strings containing "password"
psz @ 0x1000        # Show string at address 0x1000
psz 10 @ 0x1000     # Show 10-byte string at 0x1000
```

### Symbols/Imports
```
is                  # Show symbols
is~main             # Show symbols containing "main"
ii                  # Show imports
ii~printf           # Show imports containing "printf"
il                  # Show libraries
```

### Binary Info
```
iS                  # Show sections
iS~.text            # Show .text section
ih                  # Show file headers
iM                  # Show main function
iz                  # Show strings
```

### Visual Mode
```
V                   # Enter visual mode
Vp                  # Enter visual panels mode
VV                  # Enter visual graph mode
q                   # Exit visual mode
```

### Useful Aliases
```
pdf                 # Print disassembly function
px                  # Print hexdump
psz                 # Print string
pdc                 # Print disassembly with comments
```

### Search
```
/x 41414141         # Search for hex pattern
/x 41 41 41 41      # Search for hex bytes
/s password         # Search for string
/wi 0x1234          # Search for wide string
```

### Scripting
```
. script.r2         # Execute r2 script
!ls                 # Execute shell command
!cat file           # Show file content
```

### Tips
- Use `?` for help on any command
- Use `??` for detailed help
- Use `~` to filter output
- Use `@` to specify address
- Use `@@` to iterate over addresses

## r2dec Decompiler

r2dec is a decompiler plugin for radare2 that converts assembly code back to pseudo-C code.

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependency
sudo apt install gcc git make meson
# Install r2dec plugin
r2pm install r2dec

# Or manually clone and install
git clone https://github.com/radareorg/r2dec-js
cd r2dec-js
make install
```

### Basic Usage
```
pdd                 # Decompile current function
pdd @ main          # Decompile main function
pdd 10              # Decompile 10 lines
pdd @ sym.func_name # Decompile specific function
```

### Advanced Decompiler Commands
```
pddj                # Decompile to JSON format
pddg                # Decompile to graph format
pddc                # Decompile with comments
pddr                # Decompile with references
```

### Configuration
```
e asm.decompiler=true    # Enable decompiler by default
e asm.decompiler=false   # Disable decompiler
e asm.decompiler.raw=true    # Show raw decompiled output
```

### Decompiler Analysis
```
afd                 # Analyze function for decompilation
afd @ main          # Analyze specific function
afdr                # Analyze function with references
```

### Tips for r2dec
- Works best with well-analyzed binaries (`aa` command)
- May not work perfectly with obfuscated or complex code
- Use `pdf` to compare assembly with decompiled output
- Combine with `axt` to understand function calls
- Use `pddc` for better readability with comments
