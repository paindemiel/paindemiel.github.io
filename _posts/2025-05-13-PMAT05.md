# Phishing

## Excel

First we get our excel on linux and we can unzip it :

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/Excel1.png)

We could find raw byte in the vba.bin

To continue we can use  oledump.py as so :

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/Excel2.png)

We can observe that A3 got M which stand for macro so to get more information let's use oledump.py -s 3 -S <filename> :

(with -s for select and -S for strings)

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/Excel3.png)

As we see some intresting strings but also some strange character we can use --vbadecompresscorrupt :

## Word

We could use the same methodology for a .docm than for an excel in terms of macro.

However if you have a .docx it can be intresting to find possible template. You can change .docx by .zip and search for word\_rels\settings.xml.rels and in Target you'll get the macro that should be downloaded and executed :

## Ps1

As we see an iEx() instruction we can get the inside and try to do the operation without executing things after that we can understand the powershell: 

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/pw1.png)

We could also use cyberchef...

## hta

Speaking about cyberchef, after opening .hta fome we got a javascript balise with some strange code, by entenring it in cyberchef we can url decode it to get the raw script :

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/hta1.png)

## vbs

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/vbs1.png)

In that exemple we can execute the vbs to get the decoded code, by executing the script :

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/vbs2.png)

We can deobfuscate it by replace "vVv" with "" :

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/vbs3.png)

To get the capabilities of this script we could dynamically analyse it and see that it's trying to create a member and add it to multiple groups :

![Pestudio](/assets/images/phishing/vbs4.png)

In DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 correspond to shellbrowserwindow.
