## Overview

This post covers Control Flow Graph Flattening (CFGF) analysis as part of the OALAB series. We'll examine the goals, techniques, and tools used to obfuscate and deobfuscate control flow in malware analysis.

## Understanding CFGF Goals

### Primary Objectives

The main goal of CFGF is to make the analysis of control flow and overall binary analysis significantly more difficult. Originally developed for ransomware protection, CFGF was used because if analysts could understand what the malware was doing, they might find vulnerabilities in the encryption process. However, today it can be applied to any type of malware.

## OALAB CFGF Analysis

### Code and Disassembly Effects

#### Theoretical Background

Initially, we have a clean control flow, perhaps with an if-else structure where if the condition evaluates to true, the control flow goes to block B, otherwise it goes to block C, and finally to block D.

After control flow graph flattening, all [basic blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block) go into a dispatcher (in reality, the dispatcher is represented by many basic blocks, but this is the concept):

#### Practical Example

Let's use this simple example:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  if(a == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return 10;
  return 0;
}
```

The flattened version would be:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  int b = 0;
  while(1) {
    switch(b) {
      case 0:
        if(a == 0)
          b = 1;
        else
          b = 2;
        break;
      case 1:
        return 1;
      case 2:
        return 10;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Key Concepts

Basically, all basic blocks are split, placed into an infinite loop, and the program flow is now controlled by a `switch` statement and a variable `b` that defines a `state`.

### Obfuscator-LLVM

[obfuscator-llvm](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening) - The last commit was 8 years ago, making it difficult to use now, but the code snippet comes from there.

[obfuscator-llvm fork](https://github.com/eshard/obfuscator-llvm) - This fork may be worth testing.

## MODeflattener by mrt4ntr4

### Overview

[MODeflattener](https://mrt4ntr4.github.io/MODeflattener/) is a GitHub project focused on CFG deflattening. It's a Python project designed to deflatten control flow and output the deflattened binary as a new file on the file system.

### Before and After Comparison

Here's an update of the previous CFGF using MODeflattener:

### Main Obfuscators Implementing CFGF

- [OLLVM](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening)
- [Tigress](http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/transformPage/docs/flatten/index.html)
- [Hellscape](https://github.com/meme/hellscape#flattening)

## Python Script Analysis

### Control Flow Information Extraction

The script relies on the fact that the pre-dispatcher has the maximum number of predecessors, and the first successor of the pre-dispatcher is the dispatcher. From there, we also have relevant blocks as they are predecessors of the pre-dispatcher.

```python
def get_cff_info(asmcfg):
    preds = {}
    for blk in asmcfg.blocks:
        offset = asmcfg.loc_db.get_location_offset(blk.loc_key)
        preds[offset] = asmcfg.predecessors(blk.loc_key)
    pre_dispatcher = sorted(preds, key=lambda key: len(preds[key]), reverse=True)[0]
    dispatcher = asmcfg.successors(asmcfg.loc_db.get_offset_location(pre_dispatcher))[0]
    dispatcher = asmcfg.loc_db.get_location_offset(dispatcher)
```

### State Variable Analysis

The state variable is responsible for control flow. In flattened CF, we can identify it by noting that it's always initialized before the dispatcher and used in the first line of the dispatcher.

### Relevant Block Classification

#### Tail Blocks

All predecessors of the pre-dispatcher, including the tail of the backbone. The tail of the backbone is used if the state variable value doesn't satisfy any condition of the backbone - it doesn't update the state variable and only jumps to the pre-dispatcher. If we don't find any code related to modification of the state variable in a relevant block, we mark it as a tail.

#### Simple and Conditional Relevant Blocks

##### Simple Blocks
- No conditions → state variable always updated with the same value
- Only one instruction used to modify the state variable

##### Conditional Blocks
- Conditional statements and loops
- Only two possible values → depending on whether the condition results in true or false
- Often end with a `cmov` instruction, with several instructions used to modify the state variable

#### SSA Expressions (Static Single Assignment)

IR = Intermediate Representation

The system simplifies IR to SSA to deal with conditional relevant blocks by using the `do_propagate_expressions` SSA simplification pass.

In SSA form, we observe a Phi operation which means that one variable arriving from different predecessors is chosen depending on which path the control flow took.

### Useless Instruction Removal

MODeflattener uses a feature of data flow analysis from miasm. The algorithm returns all instructions affecting the state variable and calls these "useless" [more info](https://miasm.re/blog/2017/02/03/data_flow_analysis_depgraph.html).

### Patching and Control Flow Reconstruction

Call instructions are based on relative offsets, so after cleaning useless instructions, we have to fix them.

Finally, we need to generate patches for jumps and reconstruct control flow:
- For `simple` relevant blocks, we need a single patch
- For `conditional` relevant blocks, we have two patches: removing conditional move with conditional jump to true address and adding jump in succession to false address

The system then NOPs out the backbone.

## Tigress Experience

### Installation

Nothing difficult compared to OLLVM. Simply download the tigress.deb from [here](https://tigress.wtf/tigress-linux.html). You'll need some packages like gcc, perl, and maybe others, but I just created an Ubuntu container with podman using the latest tag, downloaded the tigress.deb, and installed it following the missing dependencies (completed in about 3 minutes).

### Flattening Process

After installation, I compiled a simple hello world code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main(){
    printf("Hello World");
}
```

Then used the following command for Tigress:

```bash
tigress --Transform=Flatten --Functions=main test.c --Seed=42 --out=res.c
```

### More Complex Example

With a slightly larger code for more interesting results:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main(){
    printf("Hello World");
    int a = 1;
    if (a == 0){
        printf("toto");
    } else {
        printf("tata");
    }
}
```

We can get something like this with the same command:

A non-flattened version would look like this (both flattened and non-flattened were compiled with simple `gcc`):

## Summary

CFGF analysis demonstrates sophisticated obfuscation techniques that:

- **Complicate Analysis**: Make control flow analysis significantly more difficult
- **Protect Logic**: Hide the true program flow from reverse engineers
- **Require Specialized Tools**: Need tools like MODeflattener for effective analysis
- **Evolve Continuously**: New techniques and tools emerge regularly

Understanding CFGF is crucial for modern malware analysis, as it represents a common and effective obfuscation technique used by malware authors to evade detection and analysis.
