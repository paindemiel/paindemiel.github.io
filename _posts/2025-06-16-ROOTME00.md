As the first challenges can be solved quickly I'll sum the first one here.

I won't show the flag but the methodologies for obvious reason ...

# Elf x86 - 0 protection

By opening the ch1.bin in idra and decompiling it we can see the hardcoded string against which our input is checked on so we got the flag :

![idach1](assets/images/rootme/idach1.png)

# Elf x86 - Basique

Once again we will decompile it, we get the first hardcoded string for username like in the previous challenge :
![idach2](assets/images/rootme/idach2.png)

For the second one we can sync decompiled and dissasembled code, so we get the printf basic bloc printing the flag with the two arguments where the first one is the flag (%s in the decompiled code) :

![idach3](assets/images/rootme/idach3.png)

# PE x86 - 0 protection

To start this one, as it was stripped and after start entry I was a little confused facing that much function, I just launched it from powershell which gave me the usage : `ch12.exe <pass>` :

![idach4](assets/images/rootme/idachch4-1.png)

Thanks to those test we know there is the `Wrong password` strings that we can access with shift+f12:

![idach4](assets/images/rootme/idachch4-2.png)

By double clicking on the string we can access it in .rdata and then get the xref with `x` :

![idach4](assets/images/rootme/idachch4-3.png)

As there was only one xref we can get it and go to it directly :

![idach4](assets/images/rootme/idachch4-4.png)

There we can see the comparison and the final output bu we need to search what's are a2 and a1 :

![idach4](assets/images/rootme/idachch4-5.png)

We can xref the last function and as there is only one xref we can get to it, from there we discover that a2 was the len of a1.

Moreover we know that a1 is our first arg (argv+4) so we can try to use the char that we retrieve earlier from the byte per byte comparison and we get the flag.

# ELF C++ - 0 protection 

As in the previous challenge, our mission is to find the password, because we have a main we can easily find the comparison : 

![idach5](assets/images/rootme/idachch5-1.png)

We can see line 34 that we compare our first argument and v13, above this we can see a call to `plouf(v13)`, from there we have two options, understand the operations on the string to guess the password, get the modified string dynamically.

As I want to be lazy on this one I will use the second approach :

![idach5](assets/images/rootme/idachch5-2.png)

As you can see we could load the data from ebp+14 because that's from there that the data is loaded, and by following it we get the flag :

![idach5](assets/images/rootme/idachch5-3.png)
