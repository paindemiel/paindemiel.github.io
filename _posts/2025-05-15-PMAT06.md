# Basic Static Analysis

## Pestudio

### General Characteristics
- **SHA256**: 24D004A104D4D54034DBCFFC2A4B19A11F39008A575AA614EA04703480B1022C
- **Architecture**: 32-bit
- **Original file name**: lhdfrgui.exe
- **Type**: PE

### Import Analysis
Pestudio highlights the following imported libraries: `WS2_32.dll`, `iphlpapi.dll`, and `WININET.dll`.

Among the imported functions, several interesting Windows API calls were identified (information sourced from malapi.io/microsoft), related to:
- Thread management
- File operations
- Network activity
- Randomness generation

# Basic Dynamic Analysis

At first, WannaCry did not encrypt any files. In fact, it checks if the URL found earlier (in the FLOSS section) is reachable. If the URL is accessible, the malware does not proceed with its ransomware actions. If the URL is not reachable, the payload executes.

## Regshot

Using Regshot, we detected several changes. One interesting finding is the creation of a hidden directory in `C:\ProgramData`, which contains various malware-related files (executables, text files, messages, task data, etc.).

## TCPView

We observed numerous connections to SMB (port 445) on different IP addresses:

# Conclusion

WannaCry will not execute its malicious payload if it receives a response from a specific URL (a form of anti-analysis behavior). If there is no response, it creates a hidden directory in `C:\ProgramData` to store its resources, and then begins encrypting certain files. Additionally, it attempts to connect to the SMB port on various targets.
