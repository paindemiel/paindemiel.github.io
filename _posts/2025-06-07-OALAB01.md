## Overview

This post covers the analysis of Stage 2 malware from the OALAB series - the x32 extracted payload.

## Part One: Initial Analysis

### Import and Export Analysis

#### Import Section

In the import section, we observe numerous DLLs and functions, indicating that this malware likely doesn't use dynamic DLL resolution:

![Import Analysis](/assets/images/DLL/ida15.png)

#### Export Section

![Export Analysis](/assets/images/DLL/ida16.png)

Since we only see `start` as the main entry point in exports, we can deduce we're dealing with an executable file.

### Entry Point Analysis

![Entry Point](/assets/images/DLL/ida17.png)

Our entry point is the `start` function, which includes the `security init cookie` and `C runtime start`.

![Security Init](/assets/images/DLL/ida18.png)

IDA prints some memory values in red that are located in the PE header and not loaded by default.

![PE Header Values](/assets/images/DLL/ida19.png)

To fix these "errors," we can start from scratch by opening and loading the executable manually, selecting "yes" with default values (including loading the header), and clicking "yes" on the warning.

## Part Two: Function Analysis

### sub_4011C1 - Setting SeDebugPrivilege

We begin by analyzing the first function `sub_4011C1`:

![SeDebugPrivilege Function](/assets/images/DLL/ida22.png)

This function contains 5 API calls:

- **GetCurrentProcess**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentprocess)
- **OpenProcessToken**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocesstoken)
  - The value `0x28` in OpenProcessToken represents `DesiredAccess` and corresponds to `TOKEN_QUERY`: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-rights-for-access-token-objects)
- **LookupPrivilegeValueW**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-lookupprivilegevaluew)
- **AdjustTokenPrivileges**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokenprivileges)
- **CloseHandle**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle)

#### Function Breakdown

1. Retrieve a pseudo handle to the current process
2. Get the token of the current process with `TOKEN_QUERY` access
3. Search for the LUID (Local Unique Identifier) of `SeDebugPrivilege`
4. Build a token with the previously retrieved information
5. Adjust the token privileges with the new token (giving `SeDebugPrivilege` to the current process), setting `v5` to non-zero if `AdjustTokenPrivileges` succeeds
6. Return `v5`

#### Interesting Hardcoded Executable Names

The malware targets specific executable names:

1. **CoreFrameworkHost.exe**: System component that hosts and manages the .NET Framework runtime environment
2. **CoreServiceShell.exe**: Windows system service that manages and controls the execution of core system services
3. **uiSeAgent.exe**: Interface service agent that facilitates communication between UI components and system services
4. **uiWatchDog.exe**: Monitoring process that watches over UI components' health and stability

#### Structure Reconstruction

We encounter unusual code here:

![Structure Code](/assets/images/DLL/ida23.png)

We can observe multiple strings, with the first one being accessed strangely (with `0x2C + 0x1DC = 520`). Later in the code:

![String Access](/assets/images/DLL/ida24.png)

This suggests the presence of a structure. In IDA, we can create types and build a new structure:

![Structure Creation](/assets/images/DLL/ida25.png)

After retyping `String1` and moving the length array to 260, we get:

![Structure Result](/assets/images/DLL/ida26.png)

#### Process Analysis Logic

The function performs the following operations:

1. Copy the names of 4 executables into a structure
2. Retrieve the address of `ExitProcess`
3. Take a snapshot of all current processes
4. While there is a next process in the snapshot:
   - Loop four times
   - Compare the name of one of the previously defined process names with the current process name
   - `v30` is defined as `int v30[256];`, so we can assume it stores the PIDs of the 4 previously defined processes if found
   - Open the process and retrieve the full path on disk, storing this path in the structure

#### Thread Manipulation

![Thread Manipulation](/assets/images/DLL/ida27.png)

I've renamed `v31` to `pid_idx` for better readability. The function loops through each process found in the previous part.

From the first `memset` to the first `CloseHandle`, it:
1. Takes a snapshot of all threads
2. Loops through them and stores the PID if the owner process PID matches one of our four processes

The second loop iterates through all previously stored threads with 21 as an accumulator:
1. Opens the thread with `THREAD_SET_CONTEXT` access
2. Duplicates the handle of our process to the thread
3. Uses `QueueUserAPC` to send an `ExitProcess` call

#### Final Processing

![Final Processing](/assets/images/DLL/ida28.png)

The second `for` loop iterates through the full process path found earlier. If we don't pass the condition in the second `for` loop, we enter the last `if` which retrieves system information and performs a strange `strcpy`, finally building a buffer with a format string and calling a function.

### sub_4010A3 - Scheduled Deletion with Rights

![Scheduled Deletion](/assets/images/DLL/ida29.png)

**SetFileInformationByHandle**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfileinformationbyhandle)
- **FileDispositionInfo**: The file should be deleted.

The function retrieves a handle on the full file path (possibly modified in another function) and then deletes the file.

### sub_401119 - Path Concatenation and File Creation

![Path Concatenation](/assets/images/DLL/ida30.png)

This function concatenates the host path with the network path and creates the file. The first function adds the full file path to the localhost network path and stores it in `C`, then replaces `:` (0x3A) with `$` (36), creates the file, and sets it for deletion using `SetFileInformationByHandle`.

### sub_401000 - File Deletion from Host

![File Deletion](/assets/images/DLL/ida31.png)

This function deletes the file from the file system.

### sub_40210A - Network Communication and MD5 Identifier Creation

![Network Communication](/assets/images/DLL/ida32.png)

This function retrieves more information from the host and sends it to a remote server using a POST HTTP message.

#### Addresses and Ports

The remote C2 addresses and ports:

![C2 Addresses](/assets/images/DLL/ida34.png)

We can see strange references to `a187331171`.

Looking at **InternetConnectA**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetconnecta), the second and third arguments are the address and port of the remote host.

The expression `[66 * (rand() % 4)]` randomizes to get one of 0,1,2,3, suggesting there are probably 4 IP addresses.

Looking at the strange reference, we definitely have some IPs:

![IP Addresses](/assets/images/DLL/ida35.png)

We can align on 40h to see these values easily:

![Aligned Values](/assets/images/DLL/ida36.png)

Since the port is at 64 bytes, all of this is for IP addresses. We can recreate a structure:

![IP Structure](/assets/images/DLL/ida38.png)

If we retype `a187331171` (and rename it `c2_address`), we successfully get the address and port (which is always 8080):

![C2 Structure](/assets/images/DLL/ida39.png)

### sub_401FF8 - URL Encoding

![URL Encoding](/assets/images/DLL/ida33.png)

This function encodes the buffer in URL encoding (remember that `r` converts decimal values to characters in IDA), encoding spaces into `+` and so on.

## Part Three: Dynamic Analysis

This section focuses on dynamic analysis to verify our static analysis is correct.

### Rebase Program in IDA

First, we need to sync IDA and x32dbg. We get the base address loaded in x32dbg (in Memory Section) and rebase the program in IDA (in `Edit` → `Segments` → `Rebase Program...`).

x32dbg base address:
![x32dbg Base](/assets/images/DLL/ida40.png)

IDA rebase program:
![IDA Rebase](/assets/images/DLL/ida42.png)

### Behavior Verification

Let's verify the behavior of an interesting part of our malware. Since we've synced IDA and x32dbg, we can get the `HttpSendRequestA` address:

![HttpSendRequestA](/assets/images/DLL/ida41.png)

In x32dbg, we can search for an address with `Ctrl+g` and enter the address, then set a breakpoint (we can also add comments with `;`):

![Breakpoint Setting](/assets/images/DLL/ida43.png)

#### Modify If Statement

Just before execution, we need to trick the malware because it can't kill the processes it's targeting. We need to jump into an if statement:

![If Statement](/assets/images/DLL/ida44.png)

We got the address. When reaching the breakpoint, we can double-click on ZF to modify the jump effect:

![Jump Modification](/assets/images/DLL/ida45.png)

The result is:

![Modified Jump](/assets/images/DLL/ida46.png)

Now we can see the arguments just before calling the function:

![Function Arguments](/assets/images/DLL/ida47.png)

We can check `eax` to see there's a 1, indicating the function returned successfully.

Finally, we can double-check what happened with text or pcap logs from FakeNet to see the request that was made:

![FakeNet Logs](/assets/images/DLL/ida48.png)

## Summary

This Stage 2 malware demonstrates sophisticated techniques including:

- **Privilege Escalation**: Setting SeDebugPrivilege for elevated access
- **Process Targeting**: Identifying and terminating specific antivirus processes
- **Thread Manipulation**: Using QueueUserAPC to terminate processes
- **File System Operations**: Creating and deleting files with scheduled cleanup
- **Network Communication**: Sending data to multiple C2 servers
- **Anti-Analysis**: Dynamic analysis verification of static findings

The malware shows a comprehensive approach to process termination and system manipulation, with multiple layers of functionality designed to evade detection and achieve its objectives.
