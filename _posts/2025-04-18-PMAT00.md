Welcome to my journey through the Practical Malware Analysis and Triage (PMAT) course! This series will document my progress as I work through this comprehensive course to improve and test my malware analysis skills.

## What is PMAT?

PMAT (Practical Malware Analysis and Triage) is a comprehensive course available on TCM Security that provides hands-on experience in malware analysis. The course includes practical labs and exercises designed to help analysts develop and test their malware analysis capabilities through real-world scenarios. 

Labs are available at [https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs)

### Course Coverage

The PMAT course covers essential malware analysis topics:

- **Static and Dynamic Analysis Techniques** - Core analysis methodologies
- **Anti-Analysis Techniques** - Methods malware uses to evade detection
- **Anti-Debugging Techniques** - Advanced evasion strategies
- **Special Malware Classes** - Phishing, malicious documents, and other specific types
- **Real-World Scenarios** - Practical analysis challenges

## My Learning Approach

In these posts, I'll be documenting my complete analysis journey:

### Analysis Documentation
- **Process Documentation** - Step-by-step analysis procedures for each lab
- **Challenge Documentation** - Obstacles encountered and how I overcame them
- **Tool Usage** - Tools and techniques employed during analysis
- **Learning Reflections** - Key insights gained from each exercise
- **Tips and Tricks** - Helpful techniques discovered along the way

## Safety First

**Critical Reminder**: I'll be conducting all analysis in a properly isolated virtual environment to ensure safety. Never analyze malware on your main system!

I've created a detailed post on creating a safe malware analysis environment - be sure to check it out before attempting any malware analysis.

## What to Expect

Stay tuned as I begin my journey through the PMAT course. I'll be sharing:

- **Detailed Analysis Processes** - How I approach each lab
