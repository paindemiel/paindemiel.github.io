## Virtualbox

Pros:
  - always free 
  - user friendly

# VMs 

## Linux 

### Tools 
  - Remnux with all tools ^^
  - mainly wireshark and inetsim to simulate and monitor a fake "internet"
  - can be used for maldoc with oledump etc

## Windows

### Static vs Dynamic

Basically I build a "template vm" a windows with all tools and then I copy the qcow2 and create new vm with it, static vm can be in nat because we won't launch Malwares, BUT dynamic vm will be offline or connected to a remnux, have a shared folder in readonly to share the malware and be revarted with snapshot after malware execution.

And I change the theme/Background of static and dynamic vm to avoid mistake.

### Tools

- ida (could be binaryninja, cutter, iota) : main tool for static analysis, disassembler and decompiler
- xdbg64 xdbg32 : debugger on windows
- sysinternal : all kind of monitoring tools from windows
- dnSpy : for dotnet static analysis as ida seems no to be the best 
- System informer : complete version of process explorer (sysinternal)
- Process hacker
- Pestudio : give information about file
- PeBear : let's discover what's inside a pe file
- DIE : used to detect padcker 
- HxD : hexadecimal viewer (permit extraction or modification)
- Regshot : take screenshot of registry and / or filesystems
