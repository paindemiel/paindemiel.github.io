# stage 2 x64 extracted   

The goal is to get an overview of the techniques and process for a malware analysis and not to create a complete analysis report : 

## part one

### Import / Export

#### Import 

In import section we get a lot of dll and function so there is probably no dynamic dll resolution :

![ida15](/assets/images/DLL/ida15.png)

#### Export

![ida16](/assets/images/DLL/ida16.png)

As we get only start as main entry in export we can deduce we're dealing with an `exe` file.

### Entry point

![ida17](/assets/images/DLL/ida17.png)

Our entry point is the start function, with the `security init cookie` and `c runtime start`.

![ida18](/assets/images/DLL/ida18.png)

Ida print in red some memory value which is located in the pe header and is not loaded by default by ida.

![ida19](/assets/images/DLL/ida19.png)

To fix those "errors" we can start from scratch, open and load manually the exe by selecting yes with default value (and loading header) and finally clicking yes on warning.

### WinMain

![ida21](/assets/images/DLL/ida21.png)

### sub_4011C1 - set SeDebugPrivilege

We start by analyzing the first function `sub_4011C1` :

![ida22](/assets/images/DLL/ida22.png)

So we have 5 api calls:

- GetCurrentProcess [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentprocess)
- OpenProcessToken [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocesstoken)
To discover what's does 0x28 mean in OpenProcessToken, it's a dword for DesiredAccess and it correspond to TOKEN_QUERY [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-rights-for-access-token-objects) We can search on internet or use for example token_adjust_default on visual studio and peek definition.

- LookupPrivilegeValueW [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-lookupprivilegevaluew)
- AdjustTokenPrivileges [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokenprivileges)
- CloseHandle [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle)

To breakup what's going on here :
1. We retrieve a pseudo handle to our current process
2. We get the token of our current process with TOKEN_QUERY access
3. We search the lui (local identifier) of SeDebugPrivilege 
4. We build a token with previously retrieved information
5. We adjust the token privileges with our new token (giving SeDebugPrivilege to current process) which set v5 to not zero if function AdjustTokenPrivileges end successfully
6. return v5

About Access Token those ressources are really intresting :
- [elastic windows token](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introduction-to-windows-tokens-for-security-practitioners)
- [github token viewer](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools)

## part two 

### sub_40247D - retrieve and kill processes 

#### API Calls 
- LoadLibraryW [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryw)
- GetProcAddress [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress)
- OpenProcess [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess)

- DuplicateHandle [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle)
- QueueUserAPC [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-queueuserapc)
- sleep [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleep)
- GetVersionExW [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getversionexw)
#### intresting hardcoded exe names
- Executable names :
1. CoreFrameworkHost.exe : system component that hosts and manages the .NET Framework runtime environment
2. CoreServiceShell.exe : Windows system service that manages and controls the execution of core system services, acting as a service manager for essential Windows components
3. uiseAgent.exe : interface service agent that facilitates communication between the user interface components and system services
4. uiWatchDog.exe : monitoring process that watches over UI components' health and stability, automatically detecting and recovering from UI-related issues to maintain system responsiveness

#### Reconstructing a structure ^^
We have a strange code here:

![ida23](/assets/images/DLL/ida23.png)

We can note multiple strings, first one being accessed strangely (with 0x2C + 0x1DC = 520 ), later in the code we can see :

![ida24](/assets/images/DLL/ida24.png)

So here we could suppose that there is a structure, in ida we can create type and build a new struct like so :

![ida25](/assets/images/DLL/ida25.png)

After that we can re-type String1 and move len array to 260, after that we will have something like :

![ida26](/assets/images/DLL/ida26.png)

So what's happening here is :
1. we copy in a struct the name of 4 executables 
2. we retrieve the address of `ExitProccess` 
3. we take a snapshot of all current proccessc 
4. while there is a next process in snapshot
5. loop four times 
6. comparing the name of one of our previously defined proccess name with the current proccess name in the snapshot 
7. v30 is defined as `int v30[256];` so we can assume that v30 is an array that will store the pids of the 4 previously defined proccess if they're found  
8. OpenProccess and retrieve full path on disk, store this path in struct (last while v6 loop)

Let's continue :

![ida27](/assets/images/DLL/ida27.png)

I've renamed v31 to pid_idx so it's easier to read, so we can assume we'll loop and do something on each process found in previous part.

We can see that from first memset to first CloseHandle, it take a snapshot of all thread, loop on them and store the pid if the owner process pid match the pid of one of our four processes

The second loop, iterate on all thread previously stored with 21 an accumulator, it open the thread with `THREAD_SET_CONTEXT` access, then we duplicate the handle of our process to the thread. Finally we use QueueUserAPC to send an `ExitProcess`.

Let's step into the last part of this function :

![ida28](/assets/images/DLL/ida28.png)

Here the second for loop while iterate through the full proccess path we found earlier, and we can see that if we don't pass condition in second for loop, we delve in  the last if which seems to retrieve some system information and we can see a strange strcpy, finally we're building a buffer with format string and calling a function.

### sub_4010A3 - schedule deletion with right

![ida29](/assets/images/DLL/ida29.png)

SetFileInformationByHandle [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfileinformationbyhandle)
FileDispositionInfo : The file should be deleted.


So we can see that at first we retrieve a handle on our fullfilepath (which is possibly modified in a function), and then the file will be deleted.

### sub_401119 - basically it concatenate the path host plus network and create it 

![ida30](/assets/images/DLL/ida30.png)

I wont delve into the sub function but explain what's going on here and the final purpose of this function : 

So basically the first function add our fullfilepath to localhost network path and store it in C, then it replace `:` (0x3A) by '$' (36) and finally it create the file, and setting that it should by deleted with `SetFileInformationByHandle`.

### sub_401000 - delete file from host 

![ida31](/assets/images/DLL/ida31.png)

Here this function will delete the file from our file system. 

### sub_40210A - network communication  plus md5 unique identifier creation

![ida32](/assets/images/DLL/ida32.png)

I won't delve to deep in those function but what we need to remember is that, it's retrieve more information from the host, and send them to a remote server using a post http message. 

#### addresses and port 

Just pointing out the addresses and port of remotes c2 :

![ida34](/assets/images/DLL/ida34.png)

Here we can see some strange references to `a187331171`

Looking at InternetConnectA [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetconnecta) we can see second and third arguments are address and port of remote host.

Looking back at `[66 * (rand() % 4)]` it's a randomization to get one of 0,1,2,3 so there is probably 4 ip addresses

Looking to the strange reference we definitly got some ips :

![ida35](/assets/images/DLL/ida35.png)

We can align on 40h to see through those value easily :

![ida36](/assets/images/DLL/ida36.png)

As we can see the port is at 64 byte so all of this are for ip, we can recreate a struct for that :

![ida38](/assets/images/DLL/ida38.png)

If we retype `a187331171` (and rename it `c2_address`), we successfully got the address and port (which is always 8080):

![ida39](/assets/images/DLL/ida39.png)

### sub_401FF8 - url encode 

![ida33](/assets/images/DLL/ida33.png)

So basically this one will encode our buffer in url encoding (don't forget that `r` convert decimal value to char in ida), encoding spaces into + and and so on.

## part three

Basically this part will be about dynamic analysis, to verify our static analysis is correct : 

### Rebase program in IDA

First we need to sync ida and x32dbg, to do so we get the base address loaded in x32dbg (in Memory Section) and in in rebase the program (in `Edit` -> `Segments` -> `Rebase Program...`)

x32dbg base address :
![ida40](/assets/images/DLL/ida40.png)

ida rebase program:

![ida42](/assets/images/DLL/ida42.png)

### Verify behavior 

Let's verify the behavior of an intresting part of our malware, let's say we want to check what's really requested from the malwaer. As we've sync ida and x32dbg we can get HttpSendRequestA address :

![ida41](/assets/images/DLL/ida41.png)

In x32dbg we can search an address with `Ctrl+g` and enter the address, after that we can set breakpoint, (we can also put comment with `;`) : 

![ida43](/assets/images/DLL/ida43.png)

#### Modify if statement

Just before we can execute it we need to trick the malware because it can't kill the processes it's targeting so we need to jump into an if statement :

![ida44](/assets/images/DLL/ida44.png)

So we got the address, when reaching the breakpoint we can double click of ZF to modify the jump effect :

![ida45](/assets/images/DLL/ida45.png)

The result is as follow :

![ida46](/assets/images/DLL/ida46.png)

So now we can see arguments just before calling the function :

![ida47](/assets/images/DLL/ida47.png)

And we can check eax to see there is a 1 so function returned successfully,

Finally we can double check what happened with txt or pcap logs from fakenet to see the request that was made:

![ida48](/assets/images/DLL/ida48.png)
