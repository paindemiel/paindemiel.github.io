In this lab, we'll analyze "Silko Mode," a sophisticated information stealer written in Nim that demonstrates advanced anti-analysis techniques and data exfiltration capabilities. This analysis showcases how modern malware can evade detection while stealing sensitive information.

## Basic Static Analysis

Let's begin by examining the binary's characteristics and identifying potential indicators without execution.

### PEStudio Analysis

We start by loading our malware in PEStudio to understand its basic characteristic.

#### General Characteristics
- **SHA256**: 3ACA2A08CF296F1845D6171958EF0FFD1C8BDFC3E48BDD34A605CB1F7468213E
- **Architecture**: 64-bit
- **Compiler**: MinGW GCC
- **Manifest**: winnim
- **Type**: PE

#### Import Analysis
From imported functions, we identified several interesting Windows API calls (information sourced from malapi.io/microsoft):

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| GetCurrentProcess | Used to retrieve handle for the current process |
| GetCurrentProcessId | Used to retrieve process identifier of the calling process |
| GetCurrentThreadId | Used to retrieve thread ID of calling thread |
| RtlAddFunctionTable | Adds a dynamic function table to the dynamic function table list |
| VirtualAlloc | Often used to allocate memory as part of process injection |
| VirtualProtect | Often used to modify memory protection (to allow write or execution) |
| VirtualQuery | Used to retrieve information about a range of pages in virtual address space of the calling process |

### FLOSS Analysis

#### String Analysis
From FLOSS strings analysis, we can determine that the malware is written in Nim. Key findings include:

- **Authentication-related strings**:
  - `username`
  - `password`
- **Network capabilities indicators**
- **File paths**:
  - `C:\Users\Public\passwrd.txt`
  - `@Desktop\cosmo.jpeg`
- **Suspicious URL**: `@http://cdn.altimiter.local/feed?post=`

#### Compilation Information
```
GNU C99 9.2-win32 20191008 -m64 -mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -g -O2 -std=gnu99 -fno-PIE
```

### CAPA Analysis

CAPA analysis confirms several capabilities we previously detected and reveals additional ones:
- **Software breakpoint detection**
- **Payment card validation** using Luhn algorithm
- **Data hashing** using Murmur3

### VirusTotal Analysis

Analysis results:
- **Detection rate**: 43/72
- **Community score**: -2
- **Notable capabilities**:
  - Network adapter checks
  - Self-deletion functionality

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

Now we'll examine the malware's runtime behavior in a controlled environment.

### Network Analysis (Wireshark)

#### Killswitch URL

This screen shows the URL likely used in the killswitch function, demonstrating the malware's anti-analysis capabilities.

#### Data Exfiltration
![Data Exfiltration](/assets/images/silkomode/silkoModeWireshark2.png)

The malware exfiltrates data using HTTP GET requests, passing the data in the `/feed?post=<data>` parameter.

### Process Analysis

#### System Informer

No child or new processes were detected during execution, indicating the malware operates within its own process space.

#### TCPView
![Connection Analysis](/assets/images/silkomode/silkoModeTcpView.png)

Multiple network connections were observed during the analysis, confirming the malware's network activity.

#### Process Monitor

Analysis revealed password-related activities and accessed files, providing insight into the malware's data collection behavior.

## Advanced Static Analysis

Using Cutter with the Ghidra decompiler (as the jsdec decompiler didn't provide much information), we identified several interesting functions:

### Key Functions Identified
- `checkKillSwitchURL__sikomode_25`
- `houdini__sikomode_51`
- `unpackRessources__sikomode_17`
- `stealStuff__sikomode_130`

### Function Analysis

Further analysis in Cutter reveals that:
- The **houdini function** is called in multiple places to implement self-deletion
- Other functions have explicit malicious purposes

### Encryption Analysis

In the `stealStuff__sikomode_130` function, we find evidence that data may be encrypted using RC4:

## Summary

Silko Mode is a sophisticated information stealer written in Nim that demonstrates several advanced capabilities:

- **Information Stealing**: Primarily focuses on data exfiltration from compromised systems
- **Anti-Analysis Techniques**: Implements network adapter checks and killswitch functionality
- **Data Processing**: Uses RC4 encryption for data processing and exfiltration
- **Self-Destruction**: Implements a self-deletion mechanism through its houdini function
- **Network Communication**: Establishes multiple connections to exfiltrate data through HTTP GET requests

The malware operates stealthily within its own process space and employs multiple evasion techniques to avoid detection while systematically collecting and exfiltrating sensitive information from the target system.
