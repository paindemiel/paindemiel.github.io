## Overview

This post covers the essential lab setup for malware analysis as part of the OALAB series. We'll examine different hypervisor options, virtual machine configurations, and the tools necessary for effective static and dynamic malware analysis.

## Hypervisor Selection

### QEMU/KVM + Virt-Manager

**Pros:**
- No bugs or stability issues
- Best performance characteristics
- Least detected as a virtual machine by malware
- Open-source and free

**Cons:**
- Least user-friendly interface
- Steeper learning curve for beginners

### VMware

**Pros:**
- User-friendly interface
- Excellent documentation and support
- Stable performance

**Cons:**
- Buggy on Linux systems
- Licensing changes frequently
- Commercial licensing required

### VirtualBox

**Pros:**
- Always free and open-source
- User-friendly interface
- Great community support
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Cons:**
- Buggy as hell (as noted in the original)
- Performance issues with complex workloads
- Limited advanced features

## Virtual Machine Configuration

### Linux Virtual Machines

#### Recommended Distribution: REMnux

**Tools Included:**
- Complete malware analysis toolkit
- Wireshark for network analysis
- InetSim for simulating fake "internet" environments
- OleDump and other tools for maldoc analysis

**Primary Uses:**
- Network monitoring and analysis
- Malware document analysis
- Static analysis of various file types

### Windows Virtual Machines

#### Static vs Dynamic Analysis Setup

**Template VM Approach:**
I build a "template VM" with Windows and all necessary tools, then copy the qcow2 file to create new VMs as needed.

**Static Analysis VMs:**
- Can be connected to NAT network
- Won't execute malware samples
- Used for static analysis and tool setup

**Dynamic Analysis VMs:**
- Must be offline or connected to REMnux
- Have shared folders in read-only mode for sample transfer
- Reverted with snapshots after malware execution
- Different theme/background to avoid confusion with static VMs

## Essential Analysis Tools

### Static Analysis Tools

#### Disassemblers and Decompilers
- **IDA Pro**: Primary tool for static analysis, disassembly, and decompilation
- **Binary Ninja**: Alternative to IDA with modern interface
- **Cutter**: Open-source alternative based on Radare2
- **Iota**: Lightweight disassembler for quick analysis

#### .NET Analysis
- **dnSpy**: Specialized tool for .NET static analysis (IDA is not optimal for .NET)

### Dynamic Analysis Tools

#### Debuggers
- **x64dbg/x32dbg**: Windows debuggers for dynamic analysis
- **WinDbg**: Microsoft's debugger for advanced scenarios

#### System Monitoring
- **Sysinternals Suite**: Comprehensive monitoring tools from Microsoft
- **System Informer**: Complete version of Process Explorer with enhanced features
- **Process Hacker**: Alternative process monitoring tool

### File Analysis Tools

#### PE Analysis
- **PEStudio**: Provides comprehensive information about PE files
- **PEBear**: Allows detailed exploration of PE file internals
- **DIE (Detect It Easy)**: Used to detect packers and file types

#### Hex Editors
- **HxD**: Hexadecimal viewer for file extraction and modification

### System Analysis Tools

#### Registry and File System Monitoring
- **Regshot**: Takes snapshots of registry and file system for comparison

## Lab Security Considerations

### Network Isolation
- Dynamic analysis VMs must be isolated from production networks
- Use REMnux or similar tools to simulate internet connectivity
- Implement proper network segmentation

### Sample Handling
- Use read-only shared folders for sample transfer
- Implement proper sample quarantine procedures
- Regular VM snapshots for quick recovery

### Tool Updates
- Keep analysis tools updated
- Maintain separate tool repositories for offline use
- Document tool versions and configurations
