# What I want to do next :
- Experiment maldev obfuscation and reversing it
- Experiment maldev anti-analysis and reversing it 
- Continue the exploration of OALAB series
- Maybe some wild malwares analysis

# What I didn't liked to do :
- CTF like challenges like sherlocks because it tends to take your hands to much, you don't really have the feeling of following your methodologies etc, however I may try some others, following writeup afterward if needed can be intresting
