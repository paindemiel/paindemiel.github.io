## Overview

This post covers the initial reverse engineering challenges from ROOT-ME. Since the first challenges can be solved relatively quickly, I'll summarize the methodologies used for each challenge without revealing the actual flags for obvious reasons.

## Challenge 1: ELF x86 - 0 Protection

### Analysis Approach

By opening `ch1.bin` in IDA and decompiling it, we can immediately see the hardcoded string against which our input is compared:

The hardcoded string comparison reveals the expected password, allowing us to obtain the flag.

## Challenge 2: ELF x86 - Basic

### Username Analysis

Similar to the previous challenge, we decompile the binary and find the first hardcoded string for the username:

### Password Analysis

For the second part, we can synchronize the decompiled and disassembled code. This reveals a `printf` basic block that prints the flag with two arguments, where the first argument is the flag (represented as `%s` in the decompiled code):

## Challenge 3: PE x86 - 0 Protection

### Initial Investigation

This challenge involves a stripped PE file. After the start entry point, the large number of functions was initially confusing. To understand the program's usage, I launched it from PowerShell, which revealed: `ch12.exe <pass>`

### String Analysis

Based on the test runs, we know there's a "Wrong password" string that we can locate using Shift+F12:

### Cross-Reference Analysis

By double-clicking on the string, we access it in the `.rdata` section and then get the cross-reference with `x`:

Since there was only one cross-reference, we can navigate directly to it:

### Comparison Analysis

At this location, we can see the comparison and final output, but we need to understand what `a2` and `a1` represent:

### Parameter Identification

By cross-referencing the last function (which has only one reference), we discover that `a2` represents the length of `a1`. Additionally, we know that `a1` is our first argument (`argv+4`). Using the characters retrieved from the byte-by-byte comparison, we can construct the flag.

## Challenge 4: ELF C++ - 0 Protection

### Main Function Analysis

Similar to the previous challenge, our goal is to find the password. Since we have a `main` function, we can easily locate the comparison:

![C++ Main Analysis](/assets/images/rootme/idachch5-1.png)

### Comparison Logic

On line 34, we can see the comparison between our first argument and `v13`. Above this, there's a call to `plouf(v13)`. From here, we have two options:
1. Understand the string operations to guess the password
2. Get the modified string dynamically

### Dynamic Analysis Approach

Choosing the lazy approach, I used dynamic analysis:

### Data Extraction

We can load the data from `ebp+14` since that's where the data is loaded from. By following this reference, we obtain the flag:

## Challenge 5: ELF x86 - Ptrace

### Anti-Debugging Detection

This challenge involves `ptrace`, which theoretically allows the program to determine if a debugger is present. In the `main` function, we can see the ptrace call:

### Patching Solution

One solution is to patch the program by going to Edit > Patch program > Assemble and replacing the `call ptrace` instruction with `nop` instructions:

![Program Patching](/assets/images/rootme/idachch6-2.png)

This results in:

![Patched Code](/assets/images/rootme/idachch6-3.png)

### Dynamic Analysis

After patching, we can use the same technique as before. We place a breakpoint on the comparison and dynamically update the `cflags` to modify the control flow, allowing us to obtain the password character by character:

![Dynamic Control Flow](/assets/images/rootme/idachch6-4.png)

### Result

After this process, we successfully obtain the flag (consisting of four characters).

## Summary

These initial ROOT-ME challenges demonstrate fundamental reverse engineering techniques:

- **Static Analysis**: Examining hardcoded strings and decompiled code
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Following string references to locate comparison logic
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Using debuggers to extract runtime information
- **Anti-Debugging Bypass**: Patching ptrace calls to defeat anti-debugging mechanisms
- **Control Flow Modification**: Manipulating program execution to extract secrets

Each challenge builds upon the previous ones, introducing new concepts while reinforcing core reverse engineering skills.
