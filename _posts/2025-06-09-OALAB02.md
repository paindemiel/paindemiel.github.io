# What's the goal of the CFGF process

The main goal here is to make more difficult the analysis of the control flow and overall the analysis of a binary. At first it was used for ransomware because if analyst can understand what's the malware is doing they may find vulnerabilities in the encryption process. However nowadays it can be use on every malware...

## Analysis of the effect on the code and the disassembly

### In theory 

So at the beginning we have a clean control flow, maybe an if else where if the if condition is evaluate to true the control flow goes to b else it goes to c and finally it goes to d.

After control flow graph flattening, all the [basic black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block) goes in the dispatcher (in reality the dispatcher is represented by a lot of basic block but it's the concept)

### In practice

Let's use this simple exemple :

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  if(a == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return 10;
  return 0;
}
```

The flattening exemple would be :

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  int b = 0;
  while(1) {
    switch(b) {
      case 0:
        if(a == 0)
          b = 1;
        else
          b = 2;
        break;
      case 1:
        return 1;
      case 2:
        return 10;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

So basically all the basic blocks are split, put into an infinite loop and the program flow is now controlled by a `switch` and the variable `b` which define a `state`.

### Tool

[obfuscator-llvm](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening) - last commit was 8 years ago, it's not really possible to use it anymore ^^ but the code snippet comes from there 

[obfuscator-llvm fork](https://github.com/eshard/obfuscator-llvm) I may test this one

# MODeflattener mrt4ntr4

[MODeflattener](https://mrt4ntr4.github.io/MODeflattener/) : github page about cfg deflattening 

So basically this github is a python project to deflatten control flow (pushing the deflattended binary as a new one on file system).

Update of the previous CFGF witht his one from mrt4ntr4 :

Main obfuscator implementing control flow flattening are :

- [ollvm](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening)
- tigress : http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/transformPage/docs/flatten/index.html
- [hellscape](https://github.com/meme/hellscape#flattening)

## python script explanation

### Control Flow Information

We rely on the fact that pre-dispatcher has maximum number of predecessors and first successor of pre-dispatcher is dispatcher. From there we also have relevant blocks as they are predecessors of pre-dispatcher.

```python
def get_cff_info(asmcfg):
    preds = {}
    for blk in asmcfg.blocks:
        offset = asmcfg.loc_db.get_location_offset(blk.loc_key)
        preds[offset] = asmcfg.predecessors(blk.loc_key)
    pre_dispatcher = sorted(preds, key=lambda key: len(preds[key]), reverse=True)[0]
    dispatcher = asmcfg.successors(asmcfg.loc_db.get_offset_location(pre_dispatcher))[0]
    dispatcher = asmcfg.loc_db.get_location_offset(dispatcher)
```

### State Variable

State variable is responsible of control flow, in flattened cf, we can get it stating that it's always initialized before dispatcher, used in first line of dispatcher.

### Relevant Blocks

#### Tail

All the predecessors of the pre-dispatcher, including tail of the backbone. Tail of the backbone is used if state variable value doesn't satisfy any condition of the backbone, it doesn't update state variable and only jump to pre-dispatcher. So if we don't find any code related to modification of state variable in relevant block we mark this as tail 

#### Simple and Conditional relevant block 

##### Simple 

- No conditions -> state variable always updated with same value 
- Only one instruction used to modify state variable 

##### Conditional 

- Conditional statements and loops
- Only two possible values => depending on whether the condition results is a true or false
- often end with a `cmov` instruction, several instructions used to modify state variable 

##### SSA Expressions (Static single-assignement)

IR = intermediate Representation

It simplify IR to SSA to deal with conditional relevant blocks, by using `do_propagate_expressions` ssa simplificaiton pass :

In SSA form we observe a Phi operation which basically means that one variables arriving from different predecessors is chosen depending on which path the control flow took.

#### Removing Useless Instructions

MODeflattener use a feature of data flow analysis from miasm, the algorithm returns all instructions affecting state variable and call these as useless [more info](https://miasm.re/blog/2017/02/03/data_flow_analysis_depgraph.html).

##### Pathcing and Reconstructing Control Flow

Call instructions are based on relative offsets so after cleaning useless instructions we have to fix them.

At last we need to generate patch for jumps and reconstruct control flow :
  -  For `simple` relevant block we need single patch
  - For `conditional` relevant block we have two patches, removing conditional move with conditional jump to true address and add jump in succession to false address

And it nop out the backbone.
