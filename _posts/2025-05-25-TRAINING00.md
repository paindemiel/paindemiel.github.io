## Overview

This post covers the analysis of a malware payload from HackTheBox/Sherlocks challenges. We'll examine the malware using static analysis techniques, focusing on function analysis and API call identification to understand its behavior and potential anti-analysis mechanisms. **Note: This analysis was not completed and is presented as a work in progress.**

## Initial Setup

### File Preparation

After unzipping the malware, I change the file extension to `.mal` to prevent accidental execution:

## Static Analysis

### Entry Point Analysis

Let's begin with the `start` function while PEStudio loads the malware for analysis:

![Start Function](/assets/images/hackthebox/payload/start.png)

### Function Analysis: sub_140001154

Following the entry point, we examine the function `sub_140001154`. Since this function is quite lengthy, we'll start by analyzing the API calls to understand its behavior.

#### API Call Analysis

The function contains several interesting Windows API calls:

- **[GetStartupInfoA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getstartupinfow)**: Retrieves a [StartupInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-startupinfoa) structure which describes the appearance of a GUI or terminal window
- **[Sleep](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleep)**: Temporarily pauses the execution of the current process
- **[SetUnhandledExceptionFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandledexceptionfilter)**: Allows the application to specify a function ("exception filter") that will be called whenever an unhandled exception occurs in any thread of the process
- **[NtCurrentTeb](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/nf-winnt-ntcurrentteb)**: Returns a pointer to the [Thread Environment Block](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-teb) of the current thread
- **[InterlockedCompareExchange64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/nf-winnt-interlockedcompareexchange64)**: Performs an atomic compare-and-exchange operation on specified values
- **[_initterm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/initterm-initterm-e?view=msvc-170)**: Internal runtime library method that should not typically be used directly in programs, making its presence suspicious

## Code Flow Analysis

### Infinite Loop Detection

At line 30, we encounter a `while(1)` loop that may represent a Control Flow Graph Flattening (CFGF) technique:

![Infinite Loop](/assets/images/hackthebox/payload/ida2.png)

However, since there's code execution before this loop, it might serve a different purpose than traditional CFGF.

### Function Call Chain

At line 49, there's a call to a function that ultimately leads to `vprintf`:

![Function Call](/assets/images/hackthebox/payload/ida1.png)

This suggests the malware may be performing some form of output or logging operation.

## Technical Analysis Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Anti-Analysis Techniques**: 
   - Use of `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` suggests exception handling for anti-debugging
   - `Sleep` calls may indicate timing-based anti-analysis
   - Infinite loop structure could be part of obfuscation

2. **Suspicious Elements**:
   - Direct use of `_initterm` is unusual and potentially malicious
   - `InterlockedCompareExchange64` suggests multi-threading or atomic operations
   - `NtCurrentTeb` access indicates low-level system interaction

3. **Potential Behaviors**:
   - Process information gathering via `GetStartupInfoA`
   - Exception handling setup for stability or anti-analysis
   - Possible output/logging functionality through `vprintf` chain

### Analysis Status

**Work in Progress**: This analysis is ongoing, with further investigation needed to fully understand the malware's complete functionality and purpose.
