So our first input is stored in `v11` and the second in `v10`, we can see that `v12` is the result of some operation on v11, it's multiplied by 20 and 4 is added to the result. 

If our first input is equal to the second one `v11[0] == 10` as v11 is a dword where each input is a word we have max two times a two digits number. So v11 first word is v11[0] or v11 as a word and second word is v11[1].

And then there is a comparison between `<first input>*20+4` and the second input.

To succeed, our second value must be equal to <first value>*20+4.
