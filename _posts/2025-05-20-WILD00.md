# Basic Static Analysis

sha256sum : 'e5d0c9f4a39775348bd9ab1b77df98e4b5564db19ad8048fedcff5847b76904e'

First we can open  `e5d0c9f4a39775348bd9ab1b77df98e4b5564db19ad8048fedcff5847b76904e.ps1` in notepad++, we immediatly spot the `| iex` and the `FromBase64String` method :

We could remove the iex and put the result of frombase64string in a var to output it in a file but we'll use cyberchef with frombase64 and remove null byte :

Let's break it down :

1 - We got some variables initialization with intresting informations with an exe name, scriptname vbsname and url.

2 - Here we see that the script create a directory in locted in `$LocalPath` with `Hidden` attributes.

3 - This part of the script create an executable in the previously created directory with base 64 encoded data.

4 - This part of the script download a script from the url in first part with au3 extension (AutoIt3 scripting language) 

5 - Here there is a vbs script that create a scheduled task that we'll launch the executable with the first script  as argument

6 - Finally the powershell use wscript.exe to execute the vbs script that create the scheduled task with hidden WindowStyle.

We can recreate the exe by decoding the base64 string in cyberchef and download it :

After opening it in pestudio we get :

Most probably it's the autoit3 executable that will be used to execute the downloaded autoit3 script.

I retrieved the autoIt script in an any.run vm by searching for `hxxp://104.245.106.179/comcast/1.au3` (3) and downloading the file. Then in the Files tab (1) we can search for `1.` and find the content (2):

Anyone can retrieve this script with this methodologie at : `hxxps://app.any.run/tasks/734d44a2-3e6b-429f-95a2-8e6d1a82dc35`
