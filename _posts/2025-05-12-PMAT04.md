# Basic Static Analysis

## Pestudio

We start by loading our malware in pestudio:

### General Characteristics
- **SHA256**: 3ACA2A08CF296F1845D6171958EF0FFD1C8BDFC3E48BDD34A605CB1F7468213E
- **Architecture**: 64-bit
- **Compiler**: MinGW GCC
- **Manifest**: winnim
- **Type**: PE

### Import Analysis
From imported functions, we identified several interesting Windows API calls (information sourced from malapi.io/microsoft):

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| GetCurrentProcess | Used to retrieve handle for the current process |
| GetCurrentProcessId | Used to retrieve process identifier of the calling process |
| GetCurrentThreadId | Used to retrieve thread ID of calling thread |
| RtlAddFunctionTable | Adds a dynamic function table to the dynamic function table list |
| VirtualAlloc | Often used to allocate memory as part of process injection |
| VirtualProtect | Often used to modify memory protection (to allow write or execution) |
| VirtualQuery | Used to retrieve information about a range of pages in virtual address space of the calling process |

## FLOSS

### String Analysis
From FLOSS strings analysis, we can determine that the malware is written in Nim. Key findings include:

- Authentication-related strings:
  - `username`
  - `password`
- Network capabilities indicators
- File paths:
  - `C:\Users\Public\passwrd.txt`
  - `@Desktop\cosmo.jpeg`
- Suspicious URL: `@http://cdn.altimiter.local/feed?post=`

### Compilation Information
```
GNU C99 9.2-win32 20191008 -m64 -mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -g -O2 -std=gnu99 -fno-PIE
```

## Capa

Capa analysis confirms several capabilities we previously detected and possibly reveals additional ones:
- Software breakpoint detection
- Payment card validation using Luhn algorithm
- Data hashing using Murmur3

## VirusTotal

Analysis results:
- Detection rate: 43/72
- Community score: -2
- Notable capabilities:
  - Network adapter checks
  - Self-deletion functionality

# Basic Dynamic Analysis

## Network Analysis (Wireshark)

### Killswitch URL

This screen shows the URL likely used in the killswitchurl function.

### Data Exfiltration
![Data Exfiltration](/assets/images/silkomode/silkoModeWireshark2.png)
The malware exfiltrates data using HTTP GET requests, passing the data in the `/feed?post=<data>` parameter.

## Process Analysis

### System Informer
![Process Analysis](/assets/images/silkomode/systeminformer.png)
No child or new processes were detected during execution.

### TCPView
![Connection Analysis](/assets/images/silkomode/silkoModeTcpView.png)
Multiple network connections were observed during the analysis.

### Process Monitor
![File Analysis](/assets/images/silkomode/silkoModeProcmon.png)
Analysis revealed password-related activities and accessed files.

# Advanced Static Analysis

Using Cutter with the Ghidra decompiler (as the jsdec decompiler didn't provide much information), we identified several interesting functions:

- `checkKillSwitchURL__sikomode_25`
- `houdini__sikomode_51`
- `unpackRessources__sikomode_17`
- `stealStuff__sikomode_130`

Further analysis in Cutter reveals that:
- The houdini function is called in multiple places to implement self-deletion
- Other functions have explicit malicious purposes

In addition in steelStuff__sikomode_130 We find that data may be encrypted using rc4:

# Conclusion

Silko Mode is a information stealer written in Nim that primarily focuses on data exfiltration. During execution, it implements anti-analysis techniques such network adapter checks, while searching for a specific file on the system. The malware establishes multiple network connections to exfiltrate data through HTTP GET requests. It uses RC4 encryption for data processing and implements a self-deletion mechanism through its houdini function.
