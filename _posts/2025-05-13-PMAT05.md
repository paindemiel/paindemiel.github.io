## Overview

This post covers the analysis of various special malware classes encountered in the PMAT (Practical Malware Analysis and Triage) course. We'll examine different file formats and techniques used by malware authors to deliver their payloads, including Excel macros, Word documents, PowerShell scripts, HTA files, and VBS scripts.

## Excel Document Analysis

### Initial Examination

When analyzing Excel documents, we first extract the file on Linux and unzip it to examine its internal structure:

The extraction reveals a `vba.bin` file containing raw bytes that may include malicious macros.

### Macro Detection with oledump.py

Using `oledump.py`, we can identify which streams contain macros:

In this example, stream A3 is marked with "M" indicating the presence of a macro.

### String Analysis

To extract strings from the macro stream, we use:
```bash
oledump.py -s 3 -S <filename>
```

The `-s` flag selects the stream, and `-S` extracts strings:

While we can see interesting strings, some characters appear corrupted. In such cases, we can use the `--vbadecompresscorrupt` flag to handle decompression issues.

## Word Document Analysis

### Macro-Enabled Documents (.docm)

For `.docm` files, we can apply the same methodology used for Excel files to analyze embedded macros.

### Template Injection in .docx Files

For `.docx` files, it's important to check for template injection attacks. You can:

1. Rename the `.docx` file to `.zip`
2. Extract the contents
3. Examine `word/_rels/settings.xml.rels`
4. Look for the `Target` field which may contain URLs pointing to malicious macros that will be downloaded and executed

## PowerShell Script Analysis

### Deobfuscation Techniques

When encountering PowerShell scripts with `iEx()` (Invoke-Expression) instructions, we can:

1. Extract the content inside the expression
2. Manually execute the operations step by step
3. Understand the script's functionality without executing the malicious payload

CyberChef can also be a valuable tool for PowerShell script analysis and deobfuscation.

## HTA File Analysis

### JavaScript Deobfuscation

HTA (HTML Application) files often contain obfuscated JavaScript code. After opening the `.hta` file, we typically find JavaScript tags with encoded content.

Using CyberChef, we can URL decode the obfuscated script to reveal the raw malicious code:

## VBS Script Analysis

### Initial Examination

VBS (Visual Basic Script) files often contain obfuscated code that requires multiple deobfuscation steps:

### Dynamic Execution for Decoding

In some cases, we can execute the VBS script in a controlled environment to decode the obfuscated content:

### String Replacement Deobfuscation

After execution, we can further deobfuscate by removing obfuscation strings. In this example, replacing "vVv" with empty strings reveals the actual script:

### Capability Analysis

Through dynamic analysis, we can determine the script's capabilities. In this case, the script attempts to:

- Create a new user account
- Add the user to multiple groups
- Perform privilege escalation activities

### DCOM Object Reference

The script references DCOM object `C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880`, which corresponds to the ShellBrowserWindow object, indicating potential system manipulation capabilities.

## Summary

This analysis demonstrates various techniques for examining different malware delivery mechanisms:

- **Excel/Word macros**: Use oledump.py for extraction and analysis
- **PowerShell scripts**: Deobfuscate Invoke-Expression calls manually
- **HTA files**: URL decode JavaScript content using CyberChef
- **VBS scripts**: Combine dynamic execution with string replacement for deobfuscation

Each file type requires specific analysis approaches, but the underlying goal remains the same: understand the malware's behavior without executing it in an uncontrolled environment.
