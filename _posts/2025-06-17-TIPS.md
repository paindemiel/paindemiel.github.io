## Overview

This post covers essential tips and tools for dynamic analysis in reverse engineering. We'll explore debugger hiding techniques, low-resource analysis environments, and comprehensive radare2 usage guides to enhance your reverse engineering workflow.

## Debugger Hiding: ScyllaHide

### Introduction

[ScyllaHide](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide) is a powerful tool designed to hide debuggers from anti-debugging detection mechanisms. This is particularly useful when analyzing malware that implements anti-analysis techniques.

### Installation Process

1. **Download**: Visit the GitHub repository and download the latest release (.zip file)
2. **Extract**: Unzip the downloaded file
3. **Locate Plugins**: Search for x64dbg plugins within the extracted contents
4. **Install**: Copy and paste the plugins into your x64dbg directory

### Usage

Once installed, you can:
1. Load a PE file into x64dbg
2. Load the basic profile from ScyllaHide
3. Begin your analysis with enhanced anti-detection capabilities

## Low-Resource Reverse Engineering: Podman/Radare2

### Container Setup

For resource-constrained environments, you can launch a container with radare2 using:

```bash
podman run --rm -ti radare/radare2
```

### Environment Preparation

After launching the container, update the system and install essential packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install file wget
```

### Sample Analysis

You can analyze harmless samples from platforms like [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/) by downloading them with wget and performing analysis within the container.

## Radare2 Cheatsheet

### Basic Commands

```bash
r2 -d file          # Debug mode
r2 -A file          # Analyze all
r2 -w file          # Write mode
r2 -q file          # Quiet mode
r2 -c "cmd" file    # Execute command and quit
```

### Navigation Commands

```
s main              # Seek to main function
s sym.main          # Seek to main symbol
s 0x1000            # Seek to address
s-                   # Go back

```

### Analysis Commands

```
aa                  # Analyze all
aaa                 # Analyze all (recursive)
afl                 # List all functions

```

### Memory and Register Operations

```
dr                  # Show all registers
dr eax              # Show eax register
dr eax=0x10         # Set eax to 0x10

pxw 32 @ 0x1000     # Show 32 words at address 0x1000
pxq 16 @ 0x1000     # Show 16 quadwords at address 0x1000
```

### Debugging Commands

```
db 0x1000           # Set breakpoint at 0x1000
db-0x1000           # Remove breakpoint at 0x1000
db-*                # Remove all breakpoints
dc                  # Continue execution
ds                  # Step into
dso                 # Step over
dr rip              # Show instruction pointer
```

### String and Data Analysis

```
iz                  # Show strings in data section
izz                 # Show all strings in binary
iz~password         # Show strings containing "password"
psz @ 0x1000        # Show string at address 0x1000
psz 10 @ 0x1000     # Show 10-byte string at 0x1000
```

### Symbol and Import Analysis

```
is                  # Show symbols
is~main             # Show symbols containing "main"
ii                  # Show imports
ii~printf           # Show imports containing "printf"
il                  # Show libraries
```

### Binary Information

```
iS                  # Show sections
iS~.text            # Show .text section
ih                  # Show file headers
iM                  # Show main function
iz                  # Show strings
```

### Visual Mode Operations

```
V                   # Enter visual mode
Vp                  # Enter visual panels mode
VV                  # Enter visual graph mode
q                   # Exit visual mode
```

### Useful Aliases

```

px                  # Print hexdump
psz                 # Print string
pdc                 # Print disassembly with comments
```

### Search Operations

```
/x 41414141         # Search for hex pattern
/x 41 41 41 41      # Search for hex bytes
/s password         # Search for string
/wi 0x1234          # Search for wide string
```

### Scripting and Shell Integration

```
. script.r2         # Execute r2 script
!ls                 # Execute shell command
!cat file           # Show file content
```

### General Tips

- Use `?` for help on any command
- Use `??` for detailed help
- Use `~` to filter output
- Use `@` to specify address
- Use `@@` to iterate over addresses

## R2Dec Decompiler

### Overview

R2Dec is a powerful decompiler plugin for radare2 that converts assembly code back to pseudo-C code, making complex binaries more readable and understandable.

### Installation

#### Automated Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install gcc git make meson

# Install r2dec plugin
r2pm install r2dec
```

#### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/radareorg/r2dec-js
cd r2dec-js
make install
```

### Basic Usage

```
pdd                 # Decompile current function
pdd @ main          # Decompile main function
pdd 10              # Decompile 10 lines
pdd @ sym.func_name # Decompile specific function
```

### Advanced Decompiler Commands

```
pddj                # Decompile to JSON format
pddg                # Decompile to graph format
pddc                # Decompile with comments
pddr                # Decompile with references
```

### Configuration Options

```
e asm.decompiler=true    # Enable decompiler by default
e asm.decompiler=false   # Disable decompiler
e asm.decompiler.raw=true    # Show raw decompiled output
```

### Decompiler Analysis

```
afd                 # Analyze function for decompilation
afd @ main          # Analyze specific function
afdr                # Analyze function with references
```

### Best Practices for R2Dec

- **Pre-analysis**: Run `aa` command for better decompilation results
- **Complex Code**: May not work perfectly with obfuscated or complex code
- **Comparison**: Use `pdf` to compare assembly with decompiled output
- **Cross-references**: Combine with `axt` to understand function calls
- **Readability**: Use `pddc` for better readability with comments
