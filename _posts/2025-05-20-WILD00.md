## Overview

This post covers the analysis of a PowerShell-based malware sample as part of the WILD (Wild Malware Analysis) series. The malware uses multiple layers of obfuscation and employs AutoIt3 scripting for payload delivery. We'll examine the deobfuscation process and understand the malware's deployment mechanism.

## Basic Static Analysis

### File Information
- **SHA256**: e5d0c9f4a39775348bd9ab1b77df98e4b5564db19ad8048fedcff5847b76904e
- **File Type**: PowerShell script (.ps1)

### Initial Examination

Opening the PowerShell script in Notepad++ reveals immediate signs of obfuscation:

Key indicators of malicious activity:
- `| iex` (Invoke-Expression) - Used to execute obfuscated code
- `FromBase64String` method - Indicates base64-encoded payload

### Deobfuscation Process

Instead of manually removing the `iex` and decoding the base64 string, we can use CyberChef for efficient deobfuscation:

The deobfuscation process involves:
1. Base64 decoding
2. Removal of null bytes
3. Extraction of the actual PowerShell code

## Malware Analysis Breakdown

### 1. Variable Initialization

The script begins by initializing several variables with interesting information:
- **Executable name**: Target executable for deployment
- **Script name**: VBS script filename
- **VBS name**: Visual Basic script identifier
- **URL**: Remote payload download location

### 2. Hidden Directory Creation

The malware creates a directory located in `$LocalPath` with `Hidden` attributes to conceal its presence from normal file system browsing.

### 3. Base64-Encoded Executable

This section creates an executable in the previously created hidden directory using base64-encoded data. The encoded data represents the actual payload that will be executed.

### 4. Remote Script Download

The script downloads an additional payload from the URL specified in the variable initialization. The downloaded file has an `.au3` extension, indicating it's an AutoIt3 script.

### 5. Scheduled Task Creation

A VBS script is generated that creates a scheduled task. This task is configured to:
- Launch the previously created executable
- Use the downloaded AutoIt3 script as an argument
- Execute with hidden window style for stealth

### 6. Execution Chain

Finally, the PowerShell script uses `wscript.exe` to execute the VBS script, which in turn creates the scheduled task with hidden `WindowStyle` for covert execution.

## Payload Analysis

### Executable Extraction

We can recreate the embedded executable by decoding the base64 string in CyberChef:

### PEStudio Analysis

After extracting and opening the executable in PEStudio:

Analysis reveals this is most likely the AutoIt3 executable that will be used to execute the downloaded AutoIt3 script.

## Remote Payload Retrieval

### Any.Run Analysis

The AutoIt script was retrieved from an Any.Run virtual machine by searching for the URL: `hxxp://104.245.106.179/comcast/1.au3`

![Any.Run Analysis](/assets/images/ps1-01/anyrun1.png)

To access the script content:
1. Navigate to the Files tab (1)
2. Search for "1." (2)
3. Find and examine the script content (3)

### Public Access

Anyone can retrieve this script using the same methodology at:
`hxxps://app.any.run/tasks/734d44a2-3e6b-429f-95a2-8e6d1a82dc35`

## Technical Analysis Summary

### Attack Flow

1. **Initial Execution**: PowerShell script runs with obfuscated base64 payload
2. **Environment Setup**: Creates hidden directory for malware storage
3. **Payload Deployment**: Extracts and deploys base64-encoded executable
4. **Remote Download**: Downloads AutoIt3 script from remote server
5. **Persistence**: Creates scheduled task for automatic execution
6. **Stealth Execution**: Uses hidden window style for covert operation

### Key Techniques Identified

- **Obfuscation**: Base64 encoding and Invoke-Expression usage
- **Stealth**: Hidden directories and window styles
- **Persistence**: Scheduled task creation
- **Modular Design**: Separation of loader and payload
- **Remote Delivery**: Dynamic payload download

## Conclusion

This malware demonstrates sophisticated deployment techniques combining PowerShell, VBS, and AutoIt3 scripting. The multi-stage approach with obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery makes it challenging to detect and analyze. The use of legitimate tools like AutoIt3 also helps evade traditional signature-based detection methods.

**Note: This analysis is not complete as the AU3 script was not deobfuscated and analyzed. The full malware functionality would require further analysis of the AutoIt3 payload. Compiling and decompiling the AU3 script could be an approach, but newer AutoIt3 compilers cannot be officially decompiled, making analysis more challenging.**
