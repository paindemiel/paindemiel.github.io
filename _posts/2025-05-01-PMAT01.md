This guide will help you set up a secure environment for malware analysis using FLARE-VM (Windows) and REMnux (Linux) virtual machines. A properly configured lab environment is crucial for safe and effective malware analysis.

## Lab Architecture Overview

Our malware analysis lab consists of two virtual machines connected through a host-only network:

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your lab, ensure you have the following:

- **VirtualBox**: Download the appropriate version for your host operating system from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- **Windows 10/11 Evaluation ISO**: Available from [Microsoft Eval Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/)
- **REMnux OVA**: Download from [REMnux Download Page](https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance)

## Windows VM Setup (FLARE-VM)

FLARE-VM is a script that automatically installs malware analysis tools using Chocolatey package manager, providing a comprehensive Windows environment for malware analysis.

### Initial Setup

1. Create a new Windows VM using the evaluation ISO
2. **IMPORTANT**: Take a snapshot after installation for easy recovery

### Security Configuration

Before installing FLARE-VM, we need to disable Windows security features that could interfere with malware analysis:

#### 1. Disable Proxy Auto-Detection
- Open Windows Settings
- Search for "proxy settings"
- Turn off "Automatically detect settings"

#### 2. Disable Windows Defender
- Open Windows Security
- Turn off all Defender settings
- Disable Tamper Protection

#### 3. Configure Group Policy
- Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)
- Navigate to: Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- Enable "Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus"

#### 4. Disable Windows Firewall
- In Group Policy Editor:
  - Navigate to: Administrative Templates → Network → Network Connections → Windows Defender Firewall
  - Disable "Protect All Network Connections" for both Domain and Standard profiles

#### 5. Disable Windows Update
- In Group Policy Editor:
  - Navigate to: Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows Update
  - Enable "Configure Automatic Updates" and set it to "Disabled"

#### 6. Take another snapshot

### Installing FLARE-VM

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run the following commands:

```powershell
(New-Object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/main/install.ps1',"$([Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop"))\install.ps1")
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop
Unblock-File .\install.ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
.\install.ps1
```

3. When the installation GUI appears, select the tools you want to install
4. **Take a final snapshot**

> **Note**: Cutter (GUI for radare2) is not selected by default in the FLARE-VM script. You may need to manually select it if you want to use this tool.

## REMnux Setup

REMnux provides a Linux environment specifically designed for malware analysis with pre-installed tools.

### Installation Steps

1. Import the downloaded REMnux OVA file into VirtualBox
2. Default credentials: `remnux/malware`
3. Update the system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

4. Install all REMnux tools:

```bash
remnux upgrade
```

## Network Configuration

Proper network isolation is crucial for safe malware analysis.

### Create Host-Only Network in VirtualBox

1. Open VirtualBox → File → Preferences → Network
2. Add a new Host-Only Network with these settings:

#### Adapter Settings
- **IPv4 Address**: 10.0.0.1
- **IPv4 Network Mask**: 255.255.255.0

#### DHCP Server Settings
- **Server Address**: 10.0.0.2
- **Server Mask**: 255.255.255.0
- **Lower Address Bound**: 10.0.0.3
- **Upper Address Bound**: 10.0.0.254

### Configure VM Network Adapters

1. For each VM (FLARE-VM and REMnux):
   - Right-click the VM in VirtualBox
   - Select "Settings"
   - Go to "Network" tab
   - Set Adapter Type to "Host-only Adapter"
   - Select the host-only network we created earlier
   - Click "OK" to save

## Summary

This setup provides a secure, isolated environment for malware analysis with:

- **FLARE-VM**: Windows environment with comprehensive analysis tools
- **REMnux**: Linux environment with specialized malware analysis utilities
- **Host-Only Network**: Isolated network for safe VM communication
- **Security Configurations**: Disabled Windows security features that could interfere with analysis

The lab is now ready for safe malware analysis with proper isolation and comprehensive tooling.
