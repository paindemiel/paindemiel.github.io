# BoilerPlate compiler code

## DLLEntryPoint

We start by looking at Import and Export tables, and we can see the work function in export table.

![ida1](/assets/images/DLL/ida1.png)

After that we can rename the fwdreason constant by using `m` which is DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:

![ida2](/assets/images/DLL/ida2.png)

Documentation for DLLEntryPoint : `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain`

## DLLLMainCRTSTartup

After that we see the last function before the DLLMain :

![ida3](/assets/images/DLL/ida3.png)

## DLLMain

Finally we can check the DLLMain, in that case it does nothing really interesting but in some case an attacker could have put malicious code:

![ida4](/assets/images/DLL/ida4.png)

# Human Code 

## Work 

Now we can go on `Work` function :

![ida5](/assets/images/DLL/ida5.png)

A strategie is to walk through all API calls to get an idea of the behavior of the code :
1. CreateToolHelp32Snapshot : create a snapshot of all process 
2. Process32FirstW : get the first process of our snapshot
3. Process32NextW : get next process in snapshot
4. CloseHandle : close snapshot handle
5. GetCurrentProcess : return PID of current process  
6. IsWow64Process is process 64bit or not 

In case you're wondering what `_wcsicmp` does, in short it's just a length comparison (as commented out), for full documentation you can go to [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/stricmp-wcsicmp-mbsicmp-stricmp-l-wcsicmp-l-mbsicmp-l?view=msvc-170).

![ida6](/assets/images/DLL/ida6.png)

To resume the Work function it's :
1. Take a snapshot of all Process32NextW
2. Cycle through all processes then update v0 to 1
3. If v0 == 1 then get current process PID
4. check if process is in 64 or 32 bit
5. modify the argument of a function call depend of the architecture 

After going into the function we see an update of args :

![ida7](/assets/images/DLL/ida7.png)

We now understand that there are differents args depending of the architecture, first arg is probably an embedded file as we see the magic byte `MZ` followed by the string `!This program cannot be run in dos mode.` 

![ida8](/assets/images/DLL/ida8.png)

## sub_100010E0
So let's get a first view of the function called in `Work` :

![ida9](/assets/images/DLL/ida9.png)

We can start by reviewing the api calls : 
1. GetTempPathW : [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppathw) in short get filepath for temporary files  
2. GetTempFileNameW : [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettempfilenamew) Create unique name for temporary file, if third arg is `0` then generate name with current system time
3. DeleteFileW : [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-deletefilew) delete a file 
4. MoveFileExW [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-movefileexw) in our case file is deleted when system restarts

![ida10](/assets/images/DLL/ida10.png)

A little hard point is line 14 to 21 with a subtile code optimisation :

Just before starting, a little clarification on `wcsrchr` [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strrchr-wcsrchr-mbsrchr-mbsrchr-l?view=msvc-170)
We have to note that 46 is '.' char in wcsrchr.

In summary this loop reverse the `v2` string.

## sub_10001080

![ida11](/assets/images/DLL/ida11.png)

This function dump the embedded pe in the created file in temporary directory with :
1. CreateFileW [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew)
2. WriteFile : [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile)
3. CloseHandle : [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle)

## sub_10001000

![ida12](/assets/images/DLL/ida12.png)

This function execute the previously created pe. with `shellexecuteexw` [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecuteexw)
## Extract embedded file

On ida we can find the (1) offset in the file and the (2) size to be able to extract it in `HxD`:

![ida13](/assets/images/DLL/ida13.png)

- (1) : `0001B520`
- (2) : `0x15E00`

![ida14](/assets/images/DLL/ida14.png)

So we load the dll in HxD:

- copy everything below (1) in a new file 
- in the new file cut everything below (2)

And we have our embedded file extracted.

# summary

This dll have a `Work` function which contains malicious code that :
1. Create a file in temporary directory
2. Dump content of an embedded file (which adapt to 32 or 64 architecture) in previously created file
3. execute it 
4. Schedule the deletion of this file on next boot

## notes 

### ida shortcut
- `m` : to convert value to constant name 
- `n` : to rename something 
- `space` : enter function 
- `echap` : go to previous position 
- `y` : retype something 
- `f5` : reload (useful when needing to update the args of a function in caller view) 
- `r` : convert value to char 
- `/` : to comment
