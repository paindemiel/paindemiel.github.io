## Overview

This post covers the analysis of Stage 1 malware from the OALAB (Open Analysis Lab) series. We'll examine a DLL-based dropper that contains embedded payloads.

### Sample Information
- **Source**: [UnpacMe Analysis](https://www.unpac.me/results/29587e25-18dc-43d7-8b58-0f0e7d94a541)
- **SHA256**: 93f9703cc7339014cd1bc82da0ab8909957112b93fba2430b5ee90a1d424a5ed

## Boilerplate Compiler Code Analysis

### DLL Entry Point

We begin by examining the Import and Export tables, where we can see the `Work` function in the export table:

![DLL Export Table](/assets/images/DLL/ida1.png)

Next, we can rename the `fwdreason` constant using the `m` key, which reveals it's `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`:

![DLL Process Attach](/assets/images/DLL/ida2.png)

For detailed documentation on DLLEntryPoint, refer to: [Microsoft DLL Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain)

### DLL Main CRT Startup

Following the entry point, we examine the last function before DLLMain:

![DLL Main CRT Startup](/assets/images/DLL/ida3.png)

### DLL Main Function

Finally, we check the DLLMain function. In this case, it performs no malicious operations, but attackers could potentially place malicious code here:

## Human Code Analysis

### Work Function

Now we examine the main `Work` function:

![Work Function](/assets/images/DLL/ida5.png)

### API Call Analysis

A strategic approach is to walk through all API calls to understand the code's behavior:

1. **CreateToolHelp32Snapshot**: Creates a snapshot of all processes
2. **Process32FirstW**: Gets the first process from the snapshot
3. **Process32NextW**: Gets the next process in the snapshot
4. **CloseHandle**: Closes the snapshot handle
5. **GetCurrentProcess**: Returns the PID of the current process
6. **IsWow64Process**: Determines if the process is 64-bit or 32-bit

For those wondering about `_wcsicmp`, it performs a case-insensitive string comparison. For full documentation, see [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/stricmp-wcsicmp-mbsicmp-stricmp-l-wcsicmp-l-mbsicmp-l?view=msvc-170).

### Work Function Summary

The Work function performs the following operations:
1. Takes a snapshot of all processes using Process32NextW
2. Cycles through all processes and updates `v0` to 1
3. If `v0 == 1`, gets the current process PID
4. Checks if the process is 64-bit or 32-bit
5. Modifies function call arguments based on the architecture

After entering the function, we see an update of arguments:

### Architecture-Specific Payloads

We now understand that there are different arguments depending on the architecture. The first argument is likely an embedded file, as we can see the magic bytes `MZ` followed by the string `!This program cannot be run in dos mode.`:

## Function Analysis: sub_100010E0

### Initial Overview

Let's examine the function called in `Work`:

![Function Overview](/assets/images/DLL/ida9.png)

### API Call Review

We start by reviewing the API calls:

1. **GetTempPathW**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppathw) - Gets the file path for temporary files
2. **GetTempFileNameW**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettempfilenamew) - Creates a unique name for a temporary file. If the third argument is `0`, it generates a name using the current system time
3. **DeleteFileW**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-deletefilew) - Deletes a file
4. **MoveFileExW**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-movefileexw) - In our case, the file is deleted when the system restarts

### String Reversal Logic

A challenging section is lines 14-21, which contains subtle code optimization:

Before proceeding, a clarification on `wcsrchr`: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strrchr-wcsrchr-mbsrchr-mbsrchr-l?view=msvc-170)

Note that 46 represents the '.' character in `wcsrchr`. In summary, this loop reverses the `v2` string.

## File Operations: sub_10001080

![File Operations](/assets/images/DLL/ida11.png)

This function dumps the embedded PE file to the created file in the temporary directory using:

1. **CreateFileW**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew)
2. **WriteFile**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile)
3. **CloseHandle**: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle)

## Execution: sub_10001000

![Execution Function](/assets/images/DLL/ida12.png)

This function executes the previously created PE file using `ShellExecuteExW`: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecuteexw)

## Embedded File Extraction

### Offset and Size Identification

In IDA, we can find the offset (1) and size (2) to extract the embedded file using HxD:

![Embedded File Location](/assets/images/DLL/ida13.png)

- **(1)**: `0001B520`
- **(2)**: `0x15E00`

### Extraction Process

![HxD Extraction](/assets/images/DLL/ida14.png)

To extract the embedded file:

1. Load the DLL in HxD
2. Copy everything below offset (1) to a new file
3. In the new file, cut everything below size (2)

This yields the extracted embedded file.

## Summary

This DLL contains a `Work` function with malicious code that:

1. **Creates a file** in the temporary directory
2. **Dumps content** of an embedded file (which adapts to 32 or 64-bit architecture) into the previously created file
3. **Executes** the dropped file
4. **Schedules deletion** of the file on the next boot

## IDA Shortcuts Reference

### Essential Shortcuts
- **`m`**: Convert value to constant name
- **`n`**: Rename something
- **`space`**: Enter function
- **`escape`**: Go to previous position
- **`y`**: Retype something
- **`f5`**: Reload (useful when updating function arguments in caller view)
- **`r`**: Convert value to character
- **`/`**: Add comment

These shortcuts significantly improve the efficiency of reverse engineering analysis in IDA.
