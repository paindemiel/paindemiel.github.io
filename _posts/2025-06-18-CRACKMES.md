So our first input is stored in `v11` and the second in `v10`, we can see that `v12` is the result of some operation on v11, it's multiplied by 20 and 4 is added to the result. 

If our first input is equal to the second one `v11[0] == 10` as v11 is a dword where each input is a word we have max two times a two digits number. So v11 first word is v11[0] or v11 as a word and second word is v11[1].

And then there is a comparison between `<first input>*20+4` and the second input.

To succeed, our second value must be equal to <first value>*20+4.

For this one i first tried `aaaaaa` and got `you loose`, so I entered the main function :

From there we can deduce that v3 equal the len of v3, going to label_13 is equal to loosing however going through label_9 and then label_14 is equal to winning.

Then we have a while loop comparing our input, the current char must be <= '9' and and >= '0'. Finally v-48 should be equal to v7%10. Then v11 is equal to winning string and label 14  print the message.

Honestly after seeing the '9' and '0' I've tried a lot of '0' and it worked ^^ .
