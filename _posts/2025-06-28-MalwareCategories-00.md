## Presentation

Those post will follow my lecture of MASTERING_MALWARE_ANALYSIS, which, I hope will help me learn new malware analysis skills.

## Malware categories

First we need to be able to communicate about malware categories which are generally defined by either impact or propagation method, different antivirus companies may use different logic.

### Trojan

Most universal malware category, defined by its performing of malicious activities in unaware user's environment, named for Trojan Horse used to conquer city of troy.

#### Downloader

Main goal is to download and execute external payload by any way.

#### Dropper

Payloads are not downloaded but extracted from trojan's body.

#### Backdoor

Also known as **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**, malware may receive remote commands to perform actions.

#### Ransomware

attackers prevent user from performing their activities and demand ransom to restore them. Can be done by various means, usually either locking whole system or locking access to particular files within it. Another common scenario when targeting individuals is accusing them of some criminal deed and demanding a "fine" to be paid, threatening escalation or public announcement in case of non-compliance.

#### Infostealer, aka Password Stealer (PWS)

Steal sensitive information, such as saved credentials of any kind (from other machines, financial organizations, social networks, email, etc)

#### Spyware 

quite similar to infostealer bu may also include video and audio recording or tracking victim's location with GPS.

#### Banker 

may fall into infostealer but has narrower purpose and bigger scope of potential functionality. Here, malware may be strongly focused on gaining access to money, it can support intercepting one-time tokens sent by bank as part of **two-factor authentication (2FA)**, modifying financial information to redirect payments, or injecting scripts to intercept entered banking credentials.

#### DoS 

Main goal is **Denial of Service (DOS)**, making target system or service unusable; commonly used for sabotage, hacktivism or vandalism

#### Wiper 

malware used to delete information that is either sensitive or critical to the system's operation, making it another tool for a DoS attack.

#### DDoS 

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack is launched, where multiple bots attack victim via network 

#### Spammer, aka smapbo 

Send spam on behal of victim

#### Clicker 

attacker simulate real user clicks to get money from advertisements, search engine poisoning or promoting fake accounts.

#### Miner 

Unwitting victim's machine used to mine cryptocurrencies.

#### Packed 

Not referring to actual purpose of associated threat, detection name generally means that corresponding sample is protected with malicious packer.

#### Injector 

Not referring actual purpose of threat, means corresponding sample uses process injection for some reason.

### Worm 

defined by ability to self-propagate between different machines, multiple variants of worms depending on protocol i.e IRC or media i.e email.

### Virus 

main goal of file infector is to propagate within urrent system by infecting other executables and documents. Here victim opens/launches legitimate ile, control is also given to malicious code. Several variants from writing malicious code and data into executable, adding macro templates to documents.

### Rootkit 

Doesn't have single definition, originally used to define tools elevating privileges, most commonly used for threat that either used to hide other ones or simply operate in kernel mode.

### Bootkit 

Insert themselves into booting process (i.e modifying boot sector or boot loader) to gain access before OS.

### Exploit 

Malware abuses vulnerability in victim software to achieve its goal (elevate privileges, access sensitive information, etc)

### FakeAV 

shows user various warnings about allegedly critical problems with their systems and aggressively demands "full version" of itself is bought to remediate it 

### Hoax 

Usually created as joke or an act of hooliganism, aims at scaring user about 'critical" but actually non-existent problems

### PUAs 

**Potentially Unwanted Applications** generally involve less devastating but still annonying activity, such as silently installing legitimate but unrequested applications 

### Adware 

threat displays non-requested advertisements to victims, in many cases aggressively and without an easy way to remove them 

### Hacktool 

Big category involving multiple tools that can be used by attackes and cybersecurity profesionals i.e red teaming purposes tools.

### Dual-use tools 

Corresponding can be used by attackes and legitimate user, such as system administrators i.e psexec by Sysinternals.

### Conclusion 

Many cases amples fall ino multiple categories one sample can propagate as a worm by stealing credentials and downloading additional payloads.

About **Naming conventions** as the community didn't agreed on one, there are multiple.
