This post outlines the systematic approach to malware analysis that we'll use throughout the PMAT course. Understanding this process is crucial for effective and thorough malware analysis.

## Basic Static Analysis

Static analysis involves examining the malware without executing it, providing initial insights into its capabilities and behavior.

### Key Tools and Techniques

#### FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver)
- Extracts and analyzes strings from the binary
- Reveals potential URLs, file paths, and other indicators
- Helps identify the malware's purpose and origin
- Particularly useful for detecting obfuscated strings

#### CAPA
- Identifies the malware's capabilities
- Maps findings to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Provides insights into potential attack vectors and techniques
- Helps understand the malware's overall functionality

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves examining the malware's behavior in a controlled environment. We conduct analysis both with and without network connectivity to detect potential anti-analysis techniques.

### Analysis Approach

This approach helps identify if the malware:
- Attempts to verify its execution environment
- Employs network-based anti-analysis checks
- Uses timing-based evasion techniques

### Monitoring Tools

We use a combination of tools to monitor malware activities:

#### System Monitoring
- **Sysmon**: Provides detailed system monitoring capabilities, logging process creation, network connections, file creation, and registry modifications
- **Sysmon View**: User-friendly interface to analyze Sysmon logs, making it easier to identify patterns and suspicious activities

#### Registry and File System Monitoring
- **Regshot**: Tracks changes in the file system and Windows registry between snapshots

#### Network Analysis
- **Inetsim**: Simulates network services to safely observe network communication
- **Wireshark**: Captures and analyzes network traffic in detail

#### Process Analysis
- **Process Monitor (ProcMon)**: Monitors system calls and process activities in real-time
- **Process Information**: Examines process relationships and dependencies
- **TCPView**: Monitors active TCP/IP connections and associated processes

## Advanced Static Analysis

With a better understanding of the malware's behavior from basic analysis, we dive deeper into its code structure.

### Disassembly and Decompilation
- **Cutter**: Open-source reverse engineering platform for binary analysis
- **IDA**: Industry-standard disassembler and debugger for detailed code analysis

This phase involves:
- Understanding the malware's control flow
- Identifying key functions and their purposes
- Analyzing anti-analysis techniques
- Mapping the overall program structure

## Advanced Dynamic Analysis

The final phase involves debugging the malware to uncover its core functionality and understand its execution flow.

### Debugging Tools
- **WinDbg**: Microsoft's powerful debugger for analyzing Windows applications and drivers

This phase focuses on:
- Step-by-step execution analysis
- Memory inspection and manipulation
- Understanding runtime behavior
- Identifying evasion techniques

## Analysis Workflow

This systematic approach allows us to:

1. **Gather Initial Intelligence** - Basic static analysis provides first insights
2. **Understand Behavior** - Dynamic analysis reveals runtime activities
3. **Deep Dive** - Advanced static analysis uncovers code structure
4. **Detailed Investigation** - Advanced dynamic analysis provides complete understanding

Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring thorough analysis while maintaining a safe environment.

## Summary

The PMAT malware analysis process follows a systematic approach:

- **Basic Static Analysis**: Initial examination using FLOSS and CAPA
- **Basic Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime behavior monitoring with comprehensive tools
- **Advanced Static Analysis**: Deep code examination with disassemblers
- **Advanced Dynamic Analysis**: Detailed debugging and execution analysis

This methodology ensures comprehensive malware analysis while maintaining safety and efficiency throughout the process.
